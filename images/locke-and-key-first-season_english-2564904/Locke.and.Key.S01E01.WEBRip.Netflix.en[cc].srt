[heavy breathing]

896
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,588
[Nina] Bode!

897
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,465
Mom! Come here!

898
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,549
[Nina] What's wrong?

899
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:45,803
Look.

900
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,266
Weird.

901
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,187
What is this?
Some kind of optical illusion?

902
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,740
Mom, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

903
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,159
Mom.

904
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,203
Mom!

905
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,579
[twinkling]

906
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,122
[crescendo to silence]

907
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,499
[Bode, echoing] Mom!

908
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,766
[suspenseful instrumentals]

909
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,980
[light patter of footsteps]

910
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,280
[glass shattering]

911
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,033
[echoing] Bode?

912
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,285
[echoing] Bode!

913
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,287
-Mom?
-[Nina, echoing] Bode!

914
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,788
[echoing] Bode, help me!

915
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,957
[dramatic instrumentals]

916
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,293
-[Nina] Bode, help me!
-I'm gonna go find help!

917
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,087
[Bode] Echo?

918
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,590
[yelling] Echo, we need your help!

919
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,091
[Echo] I'm here, Bode.

920
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,926
[yelling] My mom's in trouble.

921
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,637
I used the key,
and then she went through my mirror

922
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,723
and now I don't know how to get her out!

923
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,057
Can you help me?

924
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,726
Echo!

925
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,603
[dramatic crescendo]

926
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,441
I'll help you, Bode.

927
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,488
But if we're gonna save your mom,
I need you to give me the Anywhere Key.

928
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,746
Where did she go?

929
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,332
That key opens the door
to the prison of the self.

930
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,460
It's a fine place to trap your enemies.

931
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,379
I thought you said that key lets you
see people who have died!

932
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,381
Yup. And that part is true.

933
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,801
Many people have died in there
because it's very hard to get out.

934
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,055
See you around, kiddo.

935

[car approaches]

941
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,494
-Guys, help, it's Mom!
-[Kinsey] What's the matter?

942
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,204
She went through my mirror!

943
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,414
-[Tyler] What do you mean?
-I'll show you! Come on!

944
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,428
What the hell?

945
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,515
[Tyler] That can't be real.

946
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,481
Mom?

947
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:45,440
[echoing] Tyler?

948
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,318
-I have to go in.
-No!

949
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,695
[Kinsey] Here.

950
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,492
Use this to get back
when you find her, okay?

951
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,451
All right.

952
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,286
Be careful.

953
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,580
[glass shattering]

954
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,709
[Tyler whooshes through mirror]

955
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,467
Mom.

956
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,849
[glass shattering]

957
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,019
[suspenseful instrumentals intensify]

958
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,270
-[Nina, distant] Tyler!
-Mom!

959
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:24,855
[breathes heavily]

960
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,149
[Nina, echoing] Tyler!

961
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,986
-Mom!
-Tyler!

962
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,529
Mom!

963
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:33,989
[glass shattering]

964
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,073
Tyler!

-Tyler!
-Mom, close your eyes,

968
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,417
just follow my voice!

969
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,544
-Can you hear me?
-I can hear you.

970
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,670
[overlapping echoes]

971
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,796
[Tyler] Mom!

972
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,882
Over here! Close your eyes!

973
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,467
You sound closer!

974
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,010
-[Nina] I can hear you!
-Keep going!

975
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,054
[gasping and crying]

976
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,058
Pull us out!

-[digital zipping]

983

-What the hell just happened?
-[Bode] I told you,

984
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,119
these keys are for real business.

985
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,455
This is... what is this?

986
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,541
This house is full of magical keys.

987
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,839
-[Tyler exhales deeply]
-Mom?

988
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,135
Are you okay?

989
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,055
Fine. Fine!

990
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,269
Did you have fun at your party?

991
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:49,981
The mirror?

992
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,654
It's nice, right?

993
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,199
Uh... It could use some polishing.

994
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,536
[Bode] Mom!

995
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,580
You went through the mirror in there!
And then you got lost inside!

996
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,417
He's not lying.

997
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,378
You were just in there.

998
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,879
What are we talking about?

999
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:15,841
The mirror.

1000
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,260
Oh, right. [laughs]

1001
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,762
We can get you one for your room, too.

1002
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,681
I'll add it to the list.

1003

Hi, Sam.

1010
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,159
[hushed] I told you I'd come see you.
