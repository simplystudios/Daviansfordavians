00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,331
were always together,

358
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,583
cooking things up,

359
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,793
but they were all good kids.

360
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,797
Such a tragedy what happened to them.

361
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,596
Oh, [stammers] he never talked about them?

362
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,182
Huh.

363
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,058
-[eerie instrumentals]
-Not at all?

364
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,853
[receptionist] Mrs. Locke,

365
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,605
I just need one more signature from you.

366
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,899
Oh, and I better be going.

367
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,233
I got a class in a few minutes.

368
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,402
Listen, it was wonderful to meet you.

369
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,695
-You, too.
-All right.

370
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,780
-I'll see you soon.
-Yes, I hope so.

371
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,458
[indistinct chatter]

372
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,714
-Hey.
-Hi.

373
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,966
Are you here to sign up?

374
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,134
Uh...

375
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,762
No, I'm not.
I'm not really a big activities guy.

376
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,722
So, then why are you here?

377
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,017
I wanted to let you know that nothing...

378
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,686
happened between me and Eden.

379
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,481
You think I don't already know that?

380
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,358
Eden's my friend.

381
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,068
She told me everything.

382
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,321
I actually thought you were a decent guy

383
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,031
until this morning.

384
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,953
So, you don't need
to set the record straight with me...

385
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,500
but maybe instead you can go tell Javi
and Brinker what really happened.

386
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,380
No?

387
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,382
Not interested?

388
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,676
You know,

389
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,177
you can either be an asshole

390
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,971
or a good guy, Tyler.

391
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,349
You can't be both.

392
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,145
Hey, you here to sign up?

393
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,272
-Yup.
-Cool.

394
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,149
I just need your name
and your homeroom. There.

[ominous instrumentals]

396
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,494
Come sit down with me for a second.

397
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,830
Can you make it quick?
I've got hockey practice.

398

[Tyler sighs]

399
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,463
Tell me what you know about Sam Lesser.

400
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,634
I don't know. He's pretty weird, I guess.

401
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,011
Doesn't...

402
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,471
seem to have a lot of friends?

403
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,474
No, I guess not.

404
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,018
Why?

405
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,688
I was hoping that maybe
you could reach out to him.

406
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,274
He could really use the extra support.

407
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,818
-Is there a problem?
-Yeah.

408
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,946
Dad, my friends already give me
enough shit as it is.

409
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,656
They call me the guidance counselor.

410
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,741
[scoffs] Ouch.

411
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,534
[stammers] I'm just saying,

412
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,952
if I start dragging Sam around

413
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,496
like here's my freaky little pet,
they are gonna--

414
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,748
What? The world is gonna end?

415
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,667
Come on, give me a break.

416
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,378
You've got a lot of social power.
I've seen it,

417
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,172
and now I'm just asking you to use it.

418
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,631
-Dad, please.
-Actually...

419
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,842
I'm not asking.

I just-- I think it's great
that you're signing up for more stuff.

425
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,279
Maybe you can work on the newspaper,
the debate team or something--

426
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,906
Just give me a break, all right?

427
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,533
It's been two days.
I barely know my way to class.

428
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,036
I know, I'm sorry. I just...

429
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,082
I just want you guys to find
some happiness here.

430
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,501
I know.

431
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,339
Keep an eye out for Kinsey, okay?
She doesn't make friends as easily as you.

432
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,341

Um, yeah.

442
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,727
Do you sell any keys that look like this?

443
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,607
Now, that's a really cool one.

444
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,693

Wow.

Well,
that's lighter than any iron I've felt.

about this?

Hey, Logan.

552
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,052
What's up?

553
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,971
-[Logan] Something wrong?
-[Javi] Yeah.

554
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,098
Some garbage person keyed my car
for no reason.

555
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,182
[Logan] No shit!

556
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,684
Ah, that sucks.

557
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,562
-Have any idea who might have done it?
-[Javi] No.

558
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,146
[Javi] No one saw the piece of shit.

-[door closes]

561
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,694
[Brinker, hushed] Hey... Hey.

562
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,864
[sighs] I should get home.
My little brother is kinda--

563
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,990
Oh, no way, bro.

564
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,701
I'm mourning the loss of my paint job.
We need to drink.

565
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,828
-No, seriously--
-See you later, Logan.

566
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,997
[Tyler] What are you doing?

567
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,207
-[Tyler] Hey.
-Dude, it's fine. We do this all the time.

568
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,085
Bro, just tuck it under your arm
and follow our lead. Let's go.

569
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:20,044
[Brinker sighs]

570
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,923

-Are you okay?
-[grunts and sighs]

574
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,809
Look, I, um...

575
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,811
I don't even want this.

576
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,021
Can you please just...

577
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,022
take it back?

578
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:40,899
Not how it works, kid.

579
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,067
-Please, I just--
-[Logan] Hey.

580
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,404
I was wondering where you went.
I just went to the bathroom for a second,

581
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,782
which isn't the most accessible bathroom
I've ever been in.

582
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,367
Thanks for holding my beer for me, man.

583
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,077
[clerk] ID?

584
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,542
You even know this kid?

585
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,294
Yeah, that's Tyler Locke.

586
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,838
You heard of the Lockes, right?
They just moved into Key House.

587
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,257
Oh. Right. Yeah.

588
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,885
My condolences.

589
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,305
[Logan] Keep the change, man.

590
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,641
See you around, Tyler.

Bode, hi.

600
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,390
-Did you miss me?
-[door closes]

601
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,392
I had a really wonderful day
because of you.

602
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,310
It was so fun.

603
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,311
I even won you--

604
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,482
My gosh.

00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,276
[dubious instrumentals]

606
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,319
What...

607
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,905
did you find?

608
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:12,657
[trap snaps shut]

609
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,293
Bode.

610
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:30,091
Did you think you could trap me
and then make me give you back the key?

611
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,052
I thought we were friends.

612
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,762
We're not friends.

613
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,850
You lied to me
and you tried to kill my mom.

614
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,769
What other keys have you found?

615
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,354
I haven't found any more.

616
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:44,856
[hushed] Well...

617
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,443
maybe you need to try harder

618
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:51,821
and when you find them,
you're going to give them back to me.

619
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,906
-[yelling] And why would I do that?
-[sharp inhale]

620
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,367
Because when I come back,

621
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,911
-I'm not going to be so nice.
-[struggling]

[dog barks in the distance]

631
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,604
Thanks.

[beaded curtains rattle]

634
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,408
What's up? I'm Gabe.

635
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,245
Craft service?

636
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,624
[Scot] Oh, yeah, sorry.
Gabe is new to Matheson, too.

637
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,709
Yeah, we were on a frantic search
for our monster

638
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,879
so we offered him friendship in exchange
for wearing a suit that doesn't breathe.

639
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,881
-[Scot laughs]
-It does not smell awesome in here.

640
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,299
So, what exactly are you?

641
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:55,218
Wait, you mean
you've never heard of Amphropeta?

642
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,303
-It's like a local legend.
-[Scot] Half man,

643
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:00,056
half lobster, fully ticked off about
how we persecute his brethren

644
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,307
in the deep. [laughs]

645
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,060
Every now and then
he'll snatch up a fisherman or a whaler.

646
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,603
Or teenagers dry humping
on the beach.

647
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,897
He's probably untethered the soul
of one of your ancestors

648
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,940
with a mighty...

649
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,483
-[claw clomps]
-snap of the claw.

650
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:12,860
Sorry.

651
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,612
I forgive you.

652
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,030
Practical effects will be mental.

653
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,074
Zadie's been working on this application
for weeks.

654
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,033
When Gabe attacks,

655
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,910
I'm gonna make the head pop off
into the air

656
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,412
and the blood's going to spurt up
this tube and all over Eden.

657
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,414
[Eden laughs] Okay, sorry wait.

658
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,625
I didn't think
I was gonna get blood all over me.

659
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,293
[all together] It's in the script.

660
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,337
[pages rustle]

661
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,839
"Blood erupts from Nathaniel's neck

662
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,966
like a geyser and rains down
in a grisly torrent

00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,301
on Amanda as she screams."

664
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,138
But I didn't think you were actually going
to drown me in blood.

665
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,889
[Zadie] It's corn syrup and food coloring.

666
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,891
It's fully edible and washable.

667
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,228
But I don't understand
why we can't just do it without the blood.

668
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,939
Because we got the couch from Goodwill

669
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,274
and you're aware, Eden,

670
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,693
that the title of the movie is
The Splattering.

671
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,154
Well, then it's me or the blood.

672
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,446
Blood. I vote blood.

673
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,906
I mean, obviously.

674
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,452
[dog barks in the distance]

675
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,830
[stammers] Oh, I get a vote?

676
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,747
Um...

677
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,457
[stammers] Yeah, I'll say blood, too.

678
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,501
The ayes have it, Eden.

679
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,461
I'm out of here.

680
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,009
Bye. Love you.

681
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,221
[Eden] Well, you guys just destroyed
your own film.

-[Scot sighs]
-So what now?

686
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,646
Well, I don't know, Doug. Pitch me a fix.

687
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,148
Well,

688
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,816
maybe Kinsey could do it.

689
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,527
[Scot stammers] Oh, no, no...
I don't think that's a good idea.

690
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,362
Um... [stammering]

691
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,199
I don't think Kinsey's wheelhouse
is in line with this

692
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,534
particular brand of cinematic methodology.

693
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,038
No, I can do it.

694
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,499
Really? Y-Yeah?

695
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,585
Yeah, sure. [inhales]

696
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,380
But I was told
there would be smoothies. [sighs]

697
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,423
[Scot laughs]

698
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,345
-So, you are Amanda
-[smoke puffing]

699
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,932
and you just started in the early stages
of your new relationship with Nathaniel,

700
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:06,974
who in the other scenes

701
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,601
will be played by yours truly.

702
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,728
Wow, you're an actor, too?

703
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,688
-I mean...
-Actor is a stretch.

00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,523
Douglas, please with the chit chat.

705
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,608
I'm working with my lead.

706
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,525
Anyway,

707
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,737
so... you're about to sit down
and watch a movie

708
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,072
and perhaps let things progress

709
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,698
-[slurping]
-to the next proverbial base.

710
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,617
