00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,619
voilà.

181
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,120
[student] Excuse me.

182
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,333
-Oh, my God! Band of Horses tickets?
-Yeah,

183
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,834
well, no. Not exactly.

184
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,129
It's a local Band of Horses cover band.

185
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,298
Cover Band of Horses.

186
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,384
Yeah, Matheson isn't exactly
a hotbed of culture.

187
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,637
But we do actually get
some pretty good cover bands.

188
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,349
You know, we've got Novembress,
Death Lift for Cutie, Nerdvana.

189
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,477
You know, it's a...
it's a nearish approximation

190
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,771
of having
a formative concert-going experience.

191
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,358
You sure Zadie and Doug
aren't still pissed at me

192
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,776
for botching their blood gag?

193
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:51,072
Actually, this wouldn't technically be
a designated Savini Squad outing.

194
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,034
-Two tickets.
-Yeah, just...

195
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:57,662
you and I. [chuckles]

196
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,790
Oh... So this is a date?

197
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,543
Yeah, well, I mean-- God, not a date.

198
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,212
Not that word, that's...
that word's so antiquated.

199
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,797
You know, pedestrian even.

200
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,466
No, I would never deign
to make anybody feel obligated

201
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,134
to the social constructs
that exist under...

202
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,262
a dating umbrella. [laughs]

203
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,639
No, why don't we just call it a...

204
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,557
a hang?

205
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,226
-Hang?
-Hang. [laughs] Yeah.

206
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,520
So, Saturday?

207
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,649
I have a paper due
and this summer program application--

208
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,985
Okay, well, no... no pressure.
I'll just...

209
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,027
-swoop!
-[paper rustles]

210
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,237
I'll hold on to these

211
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,239
and if you want to join me,

212
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,534
great, but if it's a no,
you know, I'm a big boy.

213
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,702
I can take it. [chuckles]

214
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,036
It's a maybe.

215
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,162
Maybe?

216
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,540
[stammers] Maybe's good. Maybe's...

217
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,874
I'll take maybe. [laughs]

218
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,002
Just, uh, let me know.

219
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,004
Rocky Road.

220
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,422
[Kinsey laughs]

221
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,882
-[whistle blows]
-[air horn sounds]

222
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,634
-[air horn continues]
-[indistinct yelling]

223
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,552
[stick whacks puck]

224
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,847
-[whooshing of skates on ice]
-[sticks clatter]

225
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,348
[indistinct yelling continues]

226
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,768
[Nina] You don't have to sit with us.
Go ahead. Sit with your friends.

227
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,562
That assumes I have any.

228
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,480
So make some.

229
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,899
-[players whooshing]
-Bode.

230
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,029
-Nina!
-Hey!

231
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,489
Hi! So good to see you out here!

232
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,283
My son Tyler just joined the team.

233
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,200
Bode,

234
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,453
this is Ellie, Rufus' mom.

235
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,623
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, Bode.

236
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,042
Rufus told me
all about his fellow soldier.

237
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,835
-Bud, you wanna go find us some seats?
-Okay.

238
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,503
-[Nina] Okay.
-Bye, Ellie.

239
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,421
-Bye.
-[Nina laughs]

240
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,006
-[horn blows]
-[player 1] Right! Right!

241
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,009
-[player 2 thuds against wall]
-So how's the renovation coming along?

242
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,137
Oh, you know, fix one problem,
eight more pop up.

243
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,055
[both laugh]

244
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,973
Well, if you ever want
to get out of the house,

245
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,559
I've been wanting to check out
this new Italian place downtown?

246
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,353
Ooh... Do they have a kids' menu?

247
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,854
Probably not.

248
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,356
-Sounds perfect!
-[laughs]

249
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,066
[whooshing and yelling]

250
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,860
Jackie, I mean he's clearly into you,

251
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,613
maybe he just wanted to make you jealous
or something? I don't know.

252
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,866
It's just like a really weird situation.

253
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,701
[Jackie] Can we just watch the game?

254
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,080
[Eden] Who comes to these things
to just watch the game?

255
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,753
I didn't realize
that we had a little audience.

256
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,797
-[man] Come on, pressure!
-It's Kinsey, right?

257
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,674
[coach] Pick it up!

258
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,342
Come sit with us.

259
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,843
[woman cheers]

260
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,181
-[heavy thud]
-[man 2] Get him!

261
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,391
[applause]

262
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,184
[air horn]

263
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,852
[skates hissing on ice]

264
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,355
[man 3] Let's go!

265
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,025
I don't know
why I even bothered lacing up.

266
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,529
Relax. I've seen you at practice
and you're good but you're also new,

267
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,115
and the coach is pretty loyal to his guys.
You'll get your chance.

268
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,241
-[ice scrapes]
-[heavy thud]

269
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,283
[crowd oohs]

270
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,244
Brutal.

271
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,371
[Brinker] Yeah, that's Chad Garland.

272
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,747
All-star dickwad.

273
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,791
[gloves tap]

274
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,292
[indistinct chatter]

275
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:51,919
Yeah.

276
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,796
[Nina] Close game.

277
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,548
-[car lock beeps]
-We lost by six.

278
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,049
Still, good effort.

279
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,759
For what? Cheering from the bench?

280
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,845
-Hey, Ty, it was just the first game.
-[trunk opens]

281
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,555
You'll get more time the next game.

282
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,849
-[car engine starts]
-I'm gonna... I'm gonna go to Javi's.

283
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,183
See ya at home.

284
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,352
[indistinct chatter]

285
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,565
-[Jackie] Cool, I'll see you guys there.
-Jackie?

286
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,234
[Tyler] Uh...

287
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,445
You going to this thing at Javi's?

288
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,988
Yeah.

289
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,489
Um... [clicks tongue]

290
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:21,991
You want a ride?

291
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,242
Sure.

292
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,370
-Oh, shit.
-What?

293
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:30,416
That douchey guy was trying to get me
and Eden to go to a party tonight.

294
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,669
[Kinsey] I don't actually have anything
because I just moved here, so...

295
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,338
I think you should really let me
show you around town.

296
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,423
You okay?

297
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,468
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just get out of here.

298
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,219
[chuckles] Who is this? Your boyfriend?

299
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,638
-Her brother.
-You need to relax.

300
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,724
I mean, we're just having a conversation.

301
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,852
Is that how all your conversations go:
you talk and she tries to flee?

302
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,855
Maybe you should sit this one out.

303
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,440
Like you did most of the game.

304
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,567
Tyler.

305
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,028
-[grunting]
-Tyler!

306
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,322
-[continued grunting]
-[whack]

307
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,281
[crowd] Fight!

308
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,575
-[whack]
-[yelling] Tyler, stop! Get off him!

309
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,368
[Kinsey groans]

310
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,578
-[whack]
-[Chad grunts]

311
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,871
[crowd clamors]

312
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,372
[grunting]

313
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,916
[Tyler gasps]

314
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,251
-[dramatic instrumentals]
-Feels good, doesn't it?

315
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,295
-[man 1] Hey! Break it up.
-[man 2] Get off him!

316
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,463
[Kinsey breathes heavily]

317
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,049
Come on. Come on. Walk away.

318
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,052
-[crowd chatters indistinctly]
-[Kinsey pants]

319
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,969
[Chad groans]

320
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,180
[Joe] Well, the other player swung first.

321
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,141
But there's no question,
Tyler went too far.

322
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,560
I'll speak to Coach Riggs.

323
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,522
Probably looking at a few weeks suspension
from the team.

324
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,108
Tyler's just been so off.

325
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,487
[takes a deep breath] Down on himself,
defensive. [sighs]

326
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,571
It's understandable,

327
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,406
with everything he's been through.

328
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,408
You know, I wish I could just...

329
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,702
jump us a year into the future.

330
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,913
Get us past all the tough parts.

331
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,874
Well, you'd miss out
on some pretty great parts, too.

332
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,960
[Nina] Yeah, that's true.

333
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,254
[eerie instrumentals]

334
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,631
[Sam] Hey.

335
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,758
You waiting on your dad?

336
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,552
[Tyler] Mm-hmm.

337
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,595
[Sam] What did you do?

338
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,181
I got home late
from a hockey party last night,

339
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,393
I broke my curfew by 15 whole minutes.

340
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,310
Bummer.

341
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,522
Yeah. Dad's gonna... He's gonna give me
a whole lecture about it, so...

342
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,024
-[indistinct chatter]
-You two have been fighting a lot lately.

343
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,360
[deep breath]
I can never just make a mistake.

344
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,780
You know, it's like every little thing
becomes a moral lesson.

345
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,617
Kinsey's perfect,
but I can't catch a break.

346
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,286
[sighs] I feel you.

347
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,039
Can't tell you how many times I wake up
thinking I gotta kill my dad today.

348
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,165
[Tyler chuckles]

349
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,792
Well...

350
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,420
you ever do decide to kill your dad,

351
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,630
do me a favor:
