177
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,791
-[wall pieces rattling]
-[Ellie coughs]

178
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,501
[crowbar clanks on floor]

179
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,920
[continued coughing]

180
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,215
[curious instrumentals]

181
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,675
[light clicks on]

182
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,594
Oh, wow.

183
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,972
I feel like I just stepped back in time.

184
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,807
[chuckles] No shit.

185
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,738
[sighs heavily]

186
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,080
[Nina] Looking for something?

187
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,875
[exhales] Nothing in particular.

188
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,337
This is a strange question, but...

189
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,174
you ever remember Rendell drawing
the omega symbol?

190
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,259
Like from the Greek alphabet?

191
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,095
No, I don't ever remember him doing that.
Why?

192
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,555
[Nina] Hmm.

193
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,516
I'm sure it's nothing.

194
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,687
Mm. This is a cool piece.

195
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,066
I think it's late 1800s.

196
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:46,943
[panel rattles]

197
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,196
Don't suppose you know where the key is.

198
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:51,989
[sighs] Afraid not.

199
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,699
[Nina dusts off hands, sighs]

200
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,373
That was Rendell's chair.

201
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,752
He always liked to be
in the middle of everything.

202
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,504
I wish I'd known him back then.

203
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,266

[door closes]

207
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,113
Miss Erin, I have a surprise for you.

208
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,407
You have a visitor.

209
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,950
[phone rings in the background]

210
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,704
[nurse] This is a special day for her,
Chastity.

211
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,040
She doesn't get many visitors.

212
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,300
Have fun with your friend, okay?

213
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,510
[dubious instrumentals]

214
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,888
Hi, Vossie.

215
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,350
It's been a while.

216
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,103
[clips]

217
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,647
Don't you have anything
you wanna say to me?

218
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,648
[clips]

219
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,277
The hell happened to you?

220
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:14,947
Well...

221
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,785
you wouldn't believe the bad luck
I've had.

222
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,204
-First, your old boyfriend Rendell.
-[clips]

223
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,956
You know, he's dead, right?

224
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,252
Oops.

225
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,130
Not my fault, by the way.

226
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,218
-Then your old pal Mark went up in smoke.
-[clipping]

227
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,805
Also not my fault.

228
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,140
[clips]

229
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,683
And now you...

230
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,772
you're really not making this very easy,
are you?

231
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,232
[phone rings in the background]

232
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:51,859
It's all right.

233
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,320
[deep exhale] New plan.

234
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,240
Just have to figure out a way
to get in here.

235
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,241
[taps forehead]

236
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,790
[Dodge hums]

237
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,751
[hushed] I'll be back soon, Vossie.

238
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,049
[indistinct chatter]

239
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,098
Hey, Tyler.

240
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,599
Can I help you?

241
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,184
Sorry, I was...

242
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,228
-looking for Jackie.
-Oh,

243
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,897
well, I'll try not to be too offended.
[laughs]

244
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,693
No, Jackie's at choir practice,
she asked me to fill in.

245
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,279
Listen, how's that hand of yours healing?

246
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,574
It's fine.

247
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,827
That was a pretty good right hand.

248
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,994
You box?

249
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:45,913
No.

250
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,248
Walk with me.

251
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,083
You know, my dad...

252
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,877
he was a boxer in the Navy.

253
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,547
Taught me when I was old enough.

254
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,465
Are you good?

255
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,050
Ooh! Yeah.

256
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,095
-Well, I thought I was good. [laughs]
-[phone rings in the background]

257
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,305
I practiced, I trained, and...

258
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,975
worked out on the speed bag.

259
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,437
I was gonna be the next
light heavyweight champion of the world

260
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,399
There was this gym where one of the guys
who worked out there

261
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,735
was ranked 15th in the world, right?

262
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,279
And he was looking for sparring partners,

263
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,739
so I signed up.

264
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,824
A couple of weeks later,

265
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,493
I get in the ring with him, right?

266
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,537
And we are shuffling around, right,

267
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,080
and he's throwing jabs,

268
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,874
[grunts] and I'm dodging.

269
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,042
[grunts] Yeah, can't touch this.

270
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,252
-[imitates dodging]
-[laughs]

271
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,631
And I'm thinking to myself, "This is easy,
let me see what I can do here."

272
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,468
So I'd been working on this sneaky combo,
right?

273
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,595
So I fired that baby off.

274
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,888
[imitates jabbing]

275
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,015
Oh, yes! Yes!

276
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,767
Except everything misses.

277
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,893
[laughs]

278
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,228
And all of a sudden, pow!

279
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,730
I'm on the canvas.

280
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,356
And as I was laying there,

281
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,152
that's when I decided
that what I really wanted to do

282
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,946
was be an English teacher.

283
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,156
[both laugh]

284
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,742
-That makes total sense.
-Yeah.

285
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,453
So, where are your shadows today?

286
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,456
Brinker and Javi?

287
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,457
Flying solo.

288
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,209
-Thought I'd try something new.
-Ah.

289
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,586
That's exactly my point, Tyler.

290
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,713
New can be very good.

Afternoon, soldier.

295
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,027
Afternoon.

296
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,905
How'd those traps work out for you?
You catch the enemy?

297
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,615
Negative. [sighs]

298
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,867
That's too bad.

Hey, Rufus?

00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,041
Has your mom ever mentioned

302
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,085
anybody named Lucas?

303
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,504
-Sure. Yeah.
-[wind rushing]

304
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,507
Really?

305
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,425
Who is he?

306
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,970
He was her first love.

307
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,515
Oh. [stammers] Where is he now?

308
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,350
He-- He died.

309
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,144
Oh.

310
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,355
She still gets sad about him sometimes.

311
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,359
What do you know about the well house?

312
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,197
[crow caws]

313
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,117
My mom won't let me go near there.

[Rufus exhales]

315
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,328
Bad stuff happened here.

316
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,248
The British used Key House as a base

317
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,666
during the Revolutionary War

318
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:38,210
and they would hang defectors
in the well house.

Hey.

When do you wanna meet up?

331
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,480
For... what?

332
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,440
To get sponsors for the 5K?

333
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,901
Mr. Ridgeway said you wanted to volunteer.

334
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,903
[Tyler] Uh...

335
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,156
-If you don't want to, it's fine.
-No, I do. Uh...

336
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,450
I was just thinking that

337
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,329
we could hit up some downtown businesses
later before they close.

338
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,956
I think that's a great idea.

339
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,166
Way to go, Tyler.

340
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,376
You just saved the 5K.

341
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,628
I will see you at the car, Jackie.

342
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,130
Uh... [chuckles] Sorry.

If she doesn't have her afternoon
sugar-free Red Bull, she gets cranky.

344
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,470
Here.

345
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,305
Put your number in my phone.

346
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,523
Cool case.

347
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,275
Thanks. [laughs] I'm a total anglophile.

348
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,694
I'll see you after school.

349
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,320
Yeah.

Oh, Tyler. Good, I need your help.

I've, uh...

00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,513
signed up to volunteer for the 5K.

358
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,557
Well... you did say

359
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,434
you wanted to try something new, right?

360
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,352
Yeah, but--

361
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,771
High school is the perfect time

362
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,232
to try on a bunch of different hats.

363
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,109
You get to decide who you are,

364
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,070
-[spritzing continues]
-who you surround yourself with.

365
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,157
Feels like people pretty much
made their minds up about me.

366
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,952
New kid, dead dad, weird house.

367
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,079
Yeah, well...

368
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,499
[sighs] Look...

369
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,089
I know firsthand
that grief never gets any smaller,

370
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,468
so you have to make yourself bigger
around it.

371
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,095
The best way to do that is to open up.

372
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,139
Let people in.

373
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,599
I don't even know where to start.

374
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,061
Mm... Now when I met my wife, Callie,

375
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,981
I thought we were as opposite
as you could be.

376
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:49,318
And then I learned
that she had a thing for gardening.

377
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,154
Fiddle figs were her favorite.

378
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,572
Ficus lyrata.

379
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,742
And once we could talk about that...

380
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,661
then we could talk about anything.

381
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,874
-You play Cupid with all your students?
-[laughs] Nah,

382
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,794
just have a soft spot
for the underdog.

383
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,839

387
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,646
Take that! [chews]

-[rattling]
-[grunts]

389
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,367
[items rustle]

390
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,579
She keeps it in her sock drawer.

391
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,707
Don't say anything.

392
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,501
Understood?

393
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,086
What's in it for me?

394
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,546
[door opens]

395
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,715
[door squeaks closed]

396
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,551
[Tyler] What the--

397
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,178
It's to stop the well lady from coming in.

398
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,597
Did she come back?

399
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,350
No, not exactly. [sighs]

400
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,728
But you won't believe me
until you see her yourself.

401
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,438
Okay, so...

402
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,944
Kinsey took her fear out of her head.

403
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,362
Whoa.

404
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,613
And I was thinking

405
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,407
if she can take something out...

406
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,909
-[neck opening crinkles]
-[key crunches in opening]

407

[suspenseful instrumentals]

409
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,623
[Bode] Whoa,

410
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,126
it's the front door of our house
in Seattle.

411
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,171
...maybe I can put something in.

412
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,179
Hold on.

413
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,140
Let me see the book.

414
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,106
[Bode whispers] There's the well house.

415
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,901
[page slowly tearing]

416
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,657
Proceed.

-[door creaks closed]

420
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,304
Was something supposed to happen?

421
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,181
Ask me something about Matheson.

422
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,183
When was Matheson founded?

423
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,603
Matheson was settled in 1639,
incorporated in 1658,

424
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,772
and officially became a township in 1741.

425
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,652
-Was that right?
-I don't know. You took the book.

426
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,574
Do we have anything on England?

427

[staple gun clicking]

432
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:29,621
It's hard to believe you pulled that out
of the trash just a couple of days ago.

433
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,873
Hey...

434
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,669
it wasn't in the trash,
it was next to the trash.

435
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,504
Whatever you say.

436
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,465
It's beautiful.

437
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,050
[birds chirping]

for another, but...

440
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,266
I think they'd make an exception
for home improvement.

441
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,143
Brought you a little something.

442
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,229
[dog barks in the distance]

443
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,606
[both laugh]

444
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,192
[Nina] Perfect.

445
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,235
I love it.

446
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,697
One year, Nina.

447
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,533
-That's a big deal.
-[chuckles]

448
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,290
Thank you.

449
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,797
Different places, different faces.

450
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,515
You know, uh...

451
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,185
you helped me, too.

452
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,607
When I left home, all I wanted
was different places, different faces.

453
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,985
I found the best one.

454
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,364
[sniffles]

455
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,078
[gasps]

456
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,209
Okay, so next on the list is Harbor Cafe,
but it's all the way across town.

457
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,586
It's too bad
there's no public transportation here.

458
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,839
Ah, yes. For the thriving metropolis
that is Matheson.

459
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,674
Did you know that, um...

460
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,095
London is home to the oldest section
of underground railway in the world?

461
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,180
-[seagulls cawing]
-It opened in 1863.

462
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,182
-[car engines hum]
-I did not know that.

463
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,683
Have you been to London?

464
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,520
I went once as a kid
and I've always wanted to go back.

465
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,021
Did you also know that York

466
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,107
was the first English city
to be settled by Vikings

467
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,192
in the year 866 A.D.?

468
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,569
-[door bell rings]
-Are you into Vikings?

469
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,532
Uh... You said you were an anglophile...

470
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,451
-Um...
-Oh. Yes, I did.

471
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,370
Yeah, yeah, um... honestly though,

472
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,706
the reason I say that is
because I'm such a huge Jane Austen fan.

473
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,834
Pride and Prejudice, right?

474
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,044
-Yeah, uh...
-[indistinct street chatter]

475
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,629
That's everyone's favorite.

476
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,132
And don't get me wrong,
I love me some Mr. Darcy,

477
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,802
but my favorite's actually her last novel,
Sanditon.

478
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,512
Have you read it?

479
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,141
-Can't say I have.
-Well,

480
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,436
she got sick before she could complete it
and then after she died,

481
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,564
other writers tried to mimic her writing
and finish it,

482
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,525
but there is no mimicking Jane Austen,

483
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,653
and I'm so fascinated by the whole story.

484
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,197
Never... never met anyone else
who's read it, so...

485
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,615
I'll have to check it out.

486
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,076
It's probably not your thing.

487
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,328

[Scot guffaws]

493
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,100
Allow me.

00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,061

498
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,403
[Scot] Have you been out to the cliffs?

499
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,822
Yeah, my brother and I went out there
when we first got here.

500
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,283
So you've seen the sea caves
where them three kids drowned

501
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,201
back in the day.

502
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,036
Kids drowned down there?

503
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,831
-Oh. Yeah. [exhales]
-How is it you know all this?

504
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,167
-You're not even from Matheson.
-Well... [chuckles]

505
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,418
I went down a little bit

506
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,545
of a local lore rabbit hole

507
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,672
doing research for The Splattering.
You'd be surprised

508
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,008
what people tell you
for a free scoop of salted caramel.

509
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,259
Trust me. [laughs]

510
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,385
Come on.

[laughing] Whoa.

513
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,101
So is your family around?

514
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,396
Nah. Tyler's out and Bode's with my mom
at the hardware store,

515
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,482
which is basically like her second home.

516
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,902
Guess we have the whole place
to ourselves.

517
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,697
So, what should we do?

518
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,325
[Scot stammers]

519
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,369
-How about a tour?
-Brilliant. Yes.

520
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,374
This is the drawing room,
and just past it is the winter study.

521
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:44,376
I see.

522
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,672
And could you point me in the direction
of the autumnal study? [laughs]

523
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,591
How about I point you in the direction
of my room?

524
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,722

-Yeah, definitely.

[Russian dolls rattle]

So, I, um...

531
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,791
I'm always-- I'm always fascinated
by how many... how many things

532
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,001
[stammers] you ladies have.

533
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,503
-Definitely.
-Yeah, like,

534
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,131
what's, uh... what's this, for instance?

535
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,383
That's an eraser.

536
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,552
Knew that. [laughs]

537
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,388
[laughs] Come sit down.

538
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,442
I want to show you something.

539
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,194
Yeah?

540
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,279
[birds chirping]

541
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,572
What's that?

542
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,034
[sharp inhale] But if I show this to you,

543
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,952
-[drawer rustles open]
-you can't tell anybody

544
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,997
and you have to promise not to freak out.

545
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,041
Okay.

-Okay, whoa,

549
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,469
what's going on here? Uh... [laughs]

550
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,803
And who might you be?

551
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,764
-It's me, Kinsey.
-No,

552
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,723
see...

553
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,684
I'm hallucinating, right?
I must be hallucin--

554
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,811
You-- You're not real.
I must be hallucinating

555
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,063
because that would mean...

556
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,982
[stammers] Am I dead?

557
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:35,153
-Wait, am I dead? Am I--
-Scot! Scot, Scot. Trust me.

558
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,408
Steady on, mate.

[Scot, echoing] How is this even possible?

563
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,966
[Kinsey] We're inside my head.

564
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,096
I know, I know a mall is lame, but...

565
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:02,847
[Scot] Yes, so, how exactly

566
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,183
are we... are we inside your head?

567
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,185
[door closes]

568
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,855
Key House is full of these keys
that let you do magical stuff.

569
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,858
This one lets you go into people's heads.

570
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,986
Right, so what you're saying is...
[sharp inhale]

571
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,697
I am dead.

572
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,865
[scoffs] What I'm saying...

573
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,368
is the magic is real.

574
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,704
For us.

575
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,082
I figured you of all people
would appreciate it.

576
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,585
[blows lips and laughs]

577
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,672
You're taking the piss.

578
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,841
-Where have you taken me?
-I know it sounds crazy.

579
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,758
Crazy? No,

580
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,760
this is beyond crazy, okay?

581
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,472
This is absolutely bloody barmy.
This is completely mental.

582
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,515
[laughs] Wow.

583
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,684
You get a lot more English under stress.

584
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,311
[laughs] Come on. This way.

585
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,021
[Scot] What... [scoffs]

586
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,985
These are all filled with my memories.

587
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,071
Course they are. Why a candy shop?

588
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,407
My dad had a sweet tooth.

589
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,117
It kind of brushed off on me.

590
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:09,914
-This was my favorite birthday.
-[cube dings and clicks outward]

591
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,667
I didn't have a lot of friends,

592
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,336
so my dad planned this whole day
at the aquarium just for us.

593
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,088
I was eight.

594
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,923
Can I see?

595
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,264
[rushing effect]

596
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,600

-[young Kinsey] Who's there?

597
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:29,517
[Rendell] Fish.

598
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,977
Fish who?

599
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,228
Gesundheit.

600

[Scot chuckles]

602
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,484
-He was a bit of a comedian.
-He certainly thought so.

[both laugh]

604
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,028
[Nina] Hey.

605
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,697
They even have live sharks over there.

606
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,990
Pretty creepy, huh?

607
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,244
[rushing effect]

608
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,705
[Scot sighs heavily]

609
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,833
[scoffs] Wow.

610
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,378
Scot, are you okay?

611
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,594
I knew it.

612
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,054
I freakin' knew it.

613
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,139
I always knew. I knew magic existed.

614
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,141
This universe is way too complex

615
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,768
and random for it not to exist,
you know?

616
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,229
-[Scot laughs]
-[chuckles] Totally.

617
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,396
I mean... Ah!

618
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,483
[mellow instrumentals]

619
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,568
Are you okay?

620
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,405
I always thought it was just me
and my dad that day.

621
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,574
How come?

622
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,660
I don't know.

623
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,663
I mean, she isn't really
the traditional parent type.

624
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,039
Not like my dad was.

625
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,708
She's always been there.

626
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,046
I can't believe I blocked her
out of that memory.

627
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,423
Whoa, hey, hey... Hey, hey.

628
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,592
Don't be so hard on yourself, all right?

629
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,928
Our brains are...
they're imperfect machines.

630
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,806
They do all kinds of crazy stuff
all the time.

631
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,808
I mean, Kinsey, look at this place.

632
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,601
This is mental. [laughs]

633
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,190

Research.

643
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,689
Cool.

644
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,357
For what?

645
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,195
I know you said
it probably wasn't my thing, but...

I didn't mean for it to come off that way,
I just...

648
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,163
I felt like a complete asshole
the whole ride home.

649
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,834
Some people consider this stuff chick lit
and I hate that term, it's so sexist.

650
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,422
Almost as sexist as thinking a guy
couldn't possibly enjoy the work

651
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,466

652
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,135
I didn't realize you were so funny.

Absolutely not.

Bill's is so much better.

-They're different?
-Very different.

660
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,319
It's the best chowder in the country.

00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,364
Clearly you've never been to Seattle
because Duke's is the best in the world.

Are they from Phil's?

Phil's is trash.
Don't let anyone tell you different.

672

Relax.

00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,697
It's just chowder.

I like the new hair.

Whatever it is.
