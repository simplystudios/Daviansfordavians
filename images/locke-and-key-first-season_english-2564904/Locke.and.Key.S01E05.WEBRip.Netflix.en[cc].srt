00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,879
[continued whispering]

5
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:47,797
Hello?

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,596
Hello?

7
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,365
[whispers intensify]

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,746
[light clicks on]

9
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,968
[light clicks on]

10
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,143
[Tyler] You hear that?

11
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,606
[Kinsey] It's coming from the piano.

12
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,528
-[light clicks on]
-[Tyler] Okay...

13
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,154
Hold on, we...

14
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,115
we should think about this.

15
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,283
It's the whispering, just like Bode said.

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,786
-[cover rattles open]
-[whispering intensifies]

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,294
[off key strum]

18
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,886
You guys can hear it, too?

19
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,849
-What'd you find?
-Okay, shh.

20
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,100
Mom's still asleep.

21
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:23,893
Let me see.

22
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,815
I think I've seen this before somewhere.

23
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,316
Seen what?

24
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,694
Where it goes. Over here.

25
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,072
[chair scrapes floor]

26
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,492
-[chair whines]
-[Tyler] Just... stop.

27
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,785
[Bode sighs]

28
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,039
We need to get that brown box up there,
with the swirls.

29
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,584
I saw it when we were unpacking.

30
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,336
[Tyler scoffs]

31
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,968

[music box melody plays]

36
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,089
Abracadabra?

37
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,009
-[Bode] I think it's broken.
-[Tyler] So,

38
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,469
we can all hear them now.

39
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,221
What does that mean?

40
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,599
[Bode] That means we can all be
the protectors of the keys.

41
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,893
Well Lady can't take them from us.

42
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,270
I'm not alone anymore. [chuckles]

43
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,231
You were never alone, little man.

44
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,025
We haven't seen her for, like,
over two weeks.

45
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,403
So? In her world that could be, like,
five minutes.

46
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,614
She could be, like, 10,000 years old!

47
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,740
Yeah, okay, Bode.

48
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,492
-And she's still out there!
-I know.

49
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,579
All right, so, for safety's sake,
we should split up the keys.

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,331
Where are the other ones?

51
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,541
Right here.

52
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,418
[keys jingle]

53
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,548
Head Key, Mirror Key and Ghost Key.

54
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,009
Kinsey, you take this new music box one.

55
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,470
Bode, you keep the...

56
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,889
the Ghost Key and the Mirror Key.

57
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,933
-And I'm gonna take the Head Key.
-[hushed] Yeah!

58
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,518
Good. Always keep them with you.

59
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:33,022
And by the way, before we use the keys,
we're all talking about it first.

60
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,775
Enough with the orders!
We can manage ourselves.

61
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,860
Yeah, you're in great shape.

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,154
Just because I don't have fear
doesn't make me irrational.

63
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,614
So, shut your mouth, Tyler.

64
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,075
-[Tyler] Mm--
-Besides, it's not like you're so above

65
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:44,993
using the keys.

66
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,954
Didn't you use the Head Key
to try and get with Jackie? Hmm?

67
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,872
-Didn't you?
-[Tyler mumbles]

68
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,958
-All right, very funny.
-[muffled scream]

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,209
[panicked breathing]

70
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,670

-[Tyler pants]
-Tyler...

72
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,885
[muffled shrieks]

73
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,346
-Slap yourself in the face.
-[whack]

74

-[muffled groans]
-[Kinsey laughs]

75
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,475
-Holy shit!
-[Bode] How'd you do that?

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,395
I think it's the music box.
Tyler, open your mouth.

77
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,105
-[gasps for air]
-[Kinsey laughs]

78
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,149
Hold on, let me try this.

79
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,693
Kinsey,

80
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,361
do a back flip.

81
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,572
[music box melody continues]

82
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,036
I'm the one that put the key in...

83
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,539
so it only does what I say.

84
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,208
Bode,

85
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,002
pick your nose.

86
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,338
Oh, my God. No, no.

87
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,672
-[Bode] Ooh...
-These things...

88
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,343
-These aren't toys. They're weapons.
-[sighing]

89
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,638
So, until we need them,
we're not gonna use them.

90
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,015
Why can't they be both?

91
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,397
[spirited instrumentals]

92
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,483
Come on.

93
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:02,987
I'm not alone.

94
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,531
There's three of us now.

95
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,119
[lively instrumentals]

96
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,458

[birds chirping]

98
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,589
[Tyler] Morning, Mom.

99
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,967
-Mom?
-[toaster clanks]

100
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,678
Morning.

101
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,639
You okay?

102
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,267
Yeah, I just haven't been sleeping
all that well.

103
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,395
You know, I've had, like,

104
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,481
four different guys come take a look
at that stove and no one

105
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,525
can find anything wrong with it.

106
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,902
I just... don't get it.

107
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,738
It's probably just a fluke.

108
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,033
Isn't today your first day back
on the hockey team?

109
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,702
Actually, I'm not going back.
[crunches into apple]

110
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,371
Why wouldn't you be going back?

111
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,456
I was fourth line, Mom.
They're not gonna miss me.

112
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,499
But you love hockey.

113
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,835
Hey, can I have a piece of your toast?
Thanks, bye.

114
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,211
Already talked to coach about it.

115
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,129
-It's cool.
-Hi, Mom.

116
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,380
Bye, Mom.

117
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,093
[sighs] Don't forget,
Duncan's coming tonight for the weekend!

118
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,886
[door closes]

119
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,346

[gravel crunching under tires]

121
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,519
Bode, you're gonna miss your bus.

122
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,855
What were you doing in the shed?

123
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,273
Nothing.

124
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,483
-Did you get anything to eat?
-Love you, Mom.

125
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:23,860
[Nina stammers]

126
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,820
Love you, too.

127

[eerie instrumentals]

128
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,538
Nathaniel! [scoffs]

129
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,040
I can't believe you started the movie
without me.

130
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,005
I hope I didn't put too much butter
on the popcorn.

131
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,715
[Scot laughs] No such thing.

132
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,386

-[creature roars]

135
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,440
-[continued screaming]
-Oh, my... [laughs]

136
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,817
I ruined it.

137
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,861
What? No, no, no, no, not at all.

138
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:10,531
Your performance actually
with the scream we added is wicked.

139
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,618
You know, my blood
turned to cottage cheese. [laughs]

140
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,370
-[indistinct chatter]
-It's the rest of the damn thing.

141
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,997
[Kinsey] Not what you were hoping for?

142
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,540
[Scot] Well, let's put it this way,

143
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,126
if I was hoping
for a used car commercial,

144
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,545
I'd still be cringing
at this mess. [chuckles]

145
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,297
-It's just a rough cut.
-Rough?

146
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,132
It's bloody sandpaper.

147
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,469
Regretting your last-minute recast,
Kavandouche?

148
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:36,807
[scoffs] Actually, no,
I was just admiring Kinsey's skill.

149
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,184
[Eden] Mm...

150
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,146
A director blinded by the wannabe
he's sleeping with, how classic.

151
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,439
Eden, go away.

152
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,732
You know, it's such a shame

153
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,068
that desire has nothing to do with talent.

154
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,528
I hate to break it to you,

155
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,614
but wanting to be a director
doesn't mean that you are one.

156
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,701
You're just a pretentious,
mediocre little fanboy,

157
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,912
and that's all you're ever gonna be.

158
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,289
Mediocre being the key word.

159
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,045
Leave it. It's not worth it.

160
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,422
[Jackie] I've got track practice,

161
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,341
but did you guys want to come over
after school?

162
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,218
-We can sort out shirts.
-Yeah, sure.

163
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,643
-[door opens and closes]
-[indistinct chatter]

164
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,853
Hey, Logan, you think you could
come up with a reason

165
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,607
why you, you know...
why you can't come to Jackie's later?

166
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,525
Wow.

167
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,361
If I'm not there, who'll make sure
the larges don't get mixed in

168
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,862
-with the extra larges?
-[laughs]

169
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,490
You want some alone time with her?
It's cool.

170
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,076
Starting to get the feeling
she wouldn't mind that either.

171
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,369
Did she say something?

172
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,372
Nah, we've just been friends
for a long time.

173
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,957
I can tell.

174
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,543
Doesn't happen with her often.

175
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,461
What do you mean?

176
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,173
You know, she's not like Eden or me.
you know.

177
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,300
She's picky,

178
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,218
and I guess she picked you.

179
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,429
Don't screw it up.

180
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,723
I won't.

181
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,600
[door opens]

182
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,643
-[indistinct chatter]
-[lockers clanking]

183
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,314
Hey, you're gonna have to find
another ride after school.

184
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,523
I'm going over to Jackie's.

185
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,609
What?

186
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,739
I'm keeping it safe.

187
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,325
Didn't you say to keep them with us?

188
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,410
I said the keys.

189
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,620
Sorry.

190
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,039
Next time why don't you come up
with a complete set of rules?

191
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,709
-Don't make me that guy, Kinsey.
-That's easy, then.

192
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,128
Don't be that guy.

193
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,507
[locker slams]

194
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,302
That was aggressive. [chuckles]

195
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,262
-[zipping]
-You okay?

196
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,306
I'm just sick of bullies.

197
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,350
Well, yeah, I... I... [chuckles]

198
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,103
I've come to accept them
as an inevitable part

199
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,730
of the high school food chain.

200
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,274
What, so you just accept
the way Eden treats you?

201
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,819
[stammers] I mean, it's like...
it's like air pollution.

202
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,657
You know, you just don't really get
a choice in the matter. [laughs]

203
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,494
You know, we're not powerless here.

204
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,497
We have certain tools at our disposal.

205
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,793
Tools that open doors of possibility.

206
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,212
-[spirited instrumentals]
-Oh!

207
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,505
Oh.

208
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,006
And...

209
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,509
what exactly did you have in mind?

210
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,222
[instrumentals fade to silence]

211
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,890
-Is this a new one?
-[indistinct chatter]

212
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,684
[Kinsey] Yep, found it last night.

213
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,185
-Was it... does it...
-[dishes clank]

214
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,189
does it make any song you want
worm its way into the mind of your enemy?

215
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,401
-That's an oddly specific guess.
-I'm right,

216
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,318
though, aren't I?

217
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,528
What song shall we pick?

218
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,988
Maybe that Chumbawamba tune.

219
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,658
This is better. Watch.

220
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,458
[key rattles and cranks]

221
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,712
[music box melody plays]

222
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,841
Eden Hawkins...

223
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,635
[distorted ambient acoustics]

224
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,931
fall on your face.

225
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,143
-[Eden thuds]
-[dishes clatter]

226
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,060
[students laugh]

227
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,854
[Scot and Kinsey laugh]

228
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,693
[continued laughter]

229
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,114
[dishes and utensils clink]

230
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,077
[chuckles] Physical comedy isn't easy,
guys.

231
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,746
Think I nailed it.

232
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,330
-[students laugh]
-[girl] Yeah, you did!

233
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,374
[applause and cheering]

234
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,296
-That was incredible. [laughs]
-[music box melody continues]

235
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,797
But she's not even upset.

236
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,715
[Gabe] No way.

237
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,553
[stammering] What... Wait, how...
how did you just... [laughs]

238
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,430
Poor boy's short circuiting.

239
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,224
Listen, Gabe, you didn't just see
what you think you just...

240
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,270
-What do you think you just saw?
-I...

241
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,856
[laughs] I don't know. I mean,
I think I just saw you guys...

242
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,276
puppeteering Eden Hawkins.

243
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:01,071
-That's pretty accurate, yeah.
-[Scot chuckles]

244
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,657
This is some sort of prank,
isn't it? It is!

245
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,452
[laughs] How'd you get Eden in on it?

246
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,913
Oh, no. There's no way
she'd have been able to pull that off.

247
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,956
She's definitely not that good
of an actress.

248
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,250
It's real, but you can't tell anybody.

249
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,378
I mean, come on, you're telling me

250
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,339
that you just talk into that thing
and then she--

251
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,840
Does whatever I say.

252
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,843
You just have to put the key in
and turn it.

253
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,845
Okay, fine. Let me try.

254
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,432
[key cranking]

255
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,476
[music box melody plays]

256
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,644
Eden Hawkins,

257
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,729
-stand up.
-[bench scrapes floor]

[Eden chuckles]

-[Gabe] Make a snow angel.
-[Eden breathes heavily]

266
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,541
-[Gabe] Sit up.
-[students ooh]

267
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,417
-[Gabe] Turn over.
-[Eden gasps]

268
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,672
[Gabe] Do the breaststroke.

[shuttering continues]

275
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,408

[Eden breathes heavily]

279
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,752
Holy shit! It's actually happening.

280
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,754
-Oh, my God.
-Funny.

281
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,549
-Wait, let's make her do something else.
-Here.

282
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,552
-[Gabe laughs]
-I think that's enough now, though, right?

283
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,387
-Huh?
-What?

284
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,474
What? No, this is incredible!
And Eden is just the empirical worst, so--

285
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,934
Right, agreed. Yes, she is.

286
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,604
But, you know,
I think we've better stop the poison.

287
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,771
-[students laugh]
-All right?

288
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,357
So let's just call it a victory
and go to class.

289
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,152
[all laugh]

290
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,071
-You're making dreams come true, and--
-Yeah, maybe, but there is a limit.

291
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,698
Hey, don't touch it!

292
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,158
Well,

293
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,285
I thought that this was
about getting back at her

294
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,870
for what she said to me.

295
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:13,996
It was.

296
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,955
It is.

297
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,667
Okay, so I'm telling you,
Kinsey, I'm good.

298
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,127
Leave her be.

299
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,797
-[chuckles] Kinsey, please.
-Hey, she's getting up and cleaned up.

300
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,007
It's now or never.

301
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,635
[music box melody continues]

302
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,102
This is messed up. You guys are nuts.

303
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,439
[Kinsey laughs]

304
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,483
Thank you for meeting with me.

305
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,692
I just wanted to check in

306
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,277
and see how Tyler is doing.

307
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,530
This morning he told me
he's quitting the hockey team.

308
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,367
-He's been skating since he was seven.
-Huh.

309
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,995
Well, could be he's gotten busy
with the fundraiser now.

310
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,872
Fundraiser?

311
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,374
Yes, 5K run.

312
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,584
For cancer research.

313
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,254
He [laughs] didn't say anything about it.

314
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,589
Yeah.

315
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,467
I've been organizing it for years now.

316
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,678
So, Tyler's helping me.

317
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,347
He and some classmates.

318
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,060
They've been working every day, you know,
getting donations, sponsorships.

319
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,479
Happy to hear that.

320
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,110
[heavy sigh] I just feel like he's gotten
so far away from me.

321
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,404
Yeah, well, it's exciting to see

322
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,739
how nimble-minded
teenagers' brains can be.

323
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,617
They don't get stuck on any one idea,
they find other interests.

324
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,954
But rest assured, Nina,
Tyler is doing great.

325
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,999
I feel like he's moving
onto a brighter place.

326
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,334
[phone rings and buzzes]

327
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,255
Oh, sorry.

329
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,552
Hello?

330
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,305
Yes, this is Nina Locke.

331
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,227
I'm sorry, he did what?

-[door clicks open]
-[eerie instrumentals]

333
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,954
[Nina] I promise you're not in trouble,
okay?

334
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,833
But I need to know why you brought
a blacksmith hammer to school.

335
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,626
[Bode] For protection.

336
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:29,089
[Nina] Protection? From whom?
Who do you think's going to hurt you?

337
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,884
[Bode] You can't understand.

338
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:36,096
-I wish you could, but you just can't.
-[Nina] Oh...

339
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,473
I'll protect you, honey.

340
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,851
Nothing's gonna hurt you, I promise.

[rattling through phone]

00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,402
[whoosh]

344
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,988
[Tyler sighs] Come on.

345
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,075
Would that be an eight ball app
you've got there?

346
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,243
Maybe.

347
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:00,996
What'd you ask it?

348
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,581
I'm not gonna tell you that.

349
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:07,795
[scoffs] Come on. I didn't tell anyone
you thought George Eliott was a man.

350
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,214
I'm really not gonna tell you.

351
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,092
Someone who would use
a common misunderstanding

352
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,051
for blackmail?

353
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,803
No way.

354
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,680
-[laughs]
-Fine.

355
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,101
I don't think people should trust
fortune tellers anyway.

356
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,685
Oh, really?

357
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,770
Yes.

358
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,731
I think fortune tellers
are for lazy people

359
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,817
who let the world dictate who they are.

360
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,861
If you want something to happen,

361
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,030
make it happen.

362
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,244
[phone dings]

363
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,790
-[phone screen clicks open]
-Oh, my God.

364
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,584
What is it?

365
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,173
[clamoring and laughing on video]

366
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,386
What the hell is she doing?

367
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,347
[students ooh on video]

368
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,894
Okay, this video already has
over 3,000 views.

369
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,648
Eden loves an audience,
but why would she do this?

370
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,944
-[phone screen clicks closed]
-Something's wrong. I gotta check on her.

371
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,446
-Yeah, of course.
-[stammers] I'll text you later.

372
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,162
[doors squeaks open]

373
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,997
[Nina] Hey, take off your wet...

374
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,499
shoes.

375
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,626
[tranquil instrumentals]

376
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,253
[commotion]

377
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,089
[suspenseful instrumentals]

378
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,468
[creaking]

379
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,013
[ascending footsteps]

380
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,056
[footsteps intensify]

381
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,768
[instrumentals intensify]

382
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,396
-[door slams]
-[lock clicks]

383
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,441
-[bangs on door] Hello? It's me, Ellie.
-[gasps]

384
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,401
[breathless] Oh, Jesus, Ellie.

385
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,154
-[sighs heavily]
-It's me.

386
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,369
-I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
-[laughs]

387
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,831
Rufus left one of his guys
and he was having a total meltdown.

388
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,499
-[sighs]
-I knocked but no one was home,

389
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,376
so I just... [keys jingle]
I used Rufus's key.

390
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,546
[stammering] Ellie,
you can't just walk into my house.

391
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,924
[laughs] You should've called me first.

392
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,009
You're right.

393
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,637
You're right. I'm so sorry. [scoffs]

394
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,723
Um... I was just, uh...

395
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,310
you know, when it comes to Rufus,
I think I sometimes lose my head.

396
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,771
It's okay. [chuckles]

397
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,606
[birds chirping]

398
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,400
[clock ticking]

399
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,069
What?

400
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,490
Your scar.

401
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,742
[tense instrumentals]

402
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,535
Sorry to stare.

403
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,996
How'd you get it?

404
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,833
[sighs] I got it as a kid. [laughs]

405
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,921
[stammers] I fell off my bike.

406
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,550
First time without training wheels
and right into a bush with jagged stems.

407
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,011
[laughs] That must've hurt.

408
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,763
Oh, it did, for sure.

409
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,764
[zipping]

410
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,350
I gotta run. I'm so sorry again.

411
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,644
I promise I'll give you
a heads up next time.

412
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,187
Bye.

413
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,191
[door opens and closes]

414
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,027
-[birds chirp]
-[Gabe] We've got a goddamn magic key!

415
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,863
[Kinsey] Hey, keep it quiet.
You weren't even supposed to know.

416
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,158
I know. I'm sorry, but, I mean, I do know
and now I feel like I've got to know more.

417
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,577
In my family,
we'd call this serious questions.

418
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,997
-Ask away.
-Okay.

419
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,999
Okay, serious question:

420
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,376
-How did you find it?
-[takes a deep breath]

421
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,046
Guess you could say it kinda called to me.

422
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,590
Mm-kay. Okay.

423
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,302
Um... How does it exist?

424
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,345
Like, how do you think it got made?

425
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,099
My ancestors had a sick sense of humor?

426
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,768
-[leaves crunching]
-[Gabe] Hmm. Or, hear me out...

427
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,812
-[Kinsey] Mm-hmm...
-...you're a descendant

428
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,148
-of a coven of witches and warlocks.
-[laughs]

429
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,358
-Even better.
-Yeah, I like that.

430
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:03,488
Hmm. You know, last I checked,
that Eden video had, like, 7,000 views.

431
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,783
-[laughs] Oh, she deserved it.
-[giggles]

432
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,536
I like to think of it
more like she earned it.

433
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,539
Okay. Yeah, I like that. [laughs]

434
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,668
She put in the work and this was
her lifetime achievement award.

435
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,586
[Kinsey laughs]

436
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,423
So, why did you transfer
to Matheson Academy?

437
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,678
Uh... I didn't. My parents moved me
from my day school in Philly.

438
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:27,804
They're...

439
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,807
-[clears throat] they're getting divorced.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

440
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,267
It is what it is.

441
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,773
[sighs] Yeah, you know,
my dad's always traveling and...

442
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:38,940
[bird trilling]

443
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,819
my mom thinks it's good for me
to go to a boarding school, so...

444
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,407
Translation: she gets to pretend
that she's, like, 25 again. [scoffs]

445
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,744
-[crow caws]
-Anyway.

446
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,913
For what it's worth,

447
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,539
I'm glad you're here.

448
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,793
That's worth a lot.

449
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,586
Thanks, Kinsey.

450
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,424
Oh, hey, what's up, man?

451
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,551
We need to talk.

452
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,763
[stammers] Right. Okay. Um...

453
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,057
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll see you tomorrow then.

454
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,974
Bye.

455
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,310
See ya.

456
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,022
[door rattles open]

457
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,072
Can you turn your anger down,
like, 90 percent?

458
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:27,989
[Tyler clicks tongue]

459
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,699
Give me the key.

460
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,161
[scoffs] Oh, my God.

461
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,664
Oh, I'm serious.
Bode's gonna hold onto it,

462
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,708
because clearly he's far more mature
than you are.

463
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:45,090
You used the key at school today
when I explicitly told you not to.

464
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,217
Yeah, you did "tell" me.

465
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,220
But I did it anyway. And guess what?

466
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,638
It was awesome.

467
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,432
One of the best decisions I've ever made.

468
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,225
It's just... it's not smart.

469
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,435
You're not my parent.

470
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,816
There is a crazy, evil thing out there
who wants these keys.

471
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,985
Yeah, but she can't take them from us.

472
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,778
No, but she almost burned us all alive!

473
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,363
Except she didn't!

474
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,031
Put two and two together!

475
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,159
If she needs us to willingly give her
the keys,

476
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,786
-then she can't hurt us, can she?
-No, no, you don't know that!

477
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,038
We don't actually know anything.

478
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,417
Look, I'm sorry that you're still a slave
to your own fear, but it's not my problem.

479
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,253
Exactly, it's mine,
because I have to keep an eye on you

480
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,922
every second
so that you don't get us all killed!

481
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,215
No, actually, you don't.

482
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,801
I hereby relieve you of that burden.

483
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,261
Go.

484
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:34,556
Live your life.
Don't ever think about me again!

485
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,810
-[Tyler] Jesus Christ.
-[ascending footsteps]

486
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,941
What's going on?

487
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,488
[exhales slowly] Always good to be back.

488
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,617
[tires on gravel]

489
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,826
[lighthearted instrumentals]

490
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,538
[paper crumbles]

491
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,628
-[grunts and sighs]
-[paper thuds]

492
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,173
[knock at door]

493
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,257
Hey, man.

494
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,927
-You drawing?
-[light scraping]

495
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,012
I'm mapping out the house.

496
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,723
Cool colors.

497
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,725
-Good scale.
-[scribbling]

498
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,561
Is this what you were working on
in math class?

499
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,315
I'm guessing Mom told you to talk to me.

500
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,816
Perceptive.

501
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,945
So why don't you tell me
what happened? [sighs]

502
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,908
Some things are more important
than doing math problems.

503
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,369
[laughs] Fair point.

504
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,580
You want to tell me
what is more important?

505
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,457
Mom,

506
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,877
Tyler, Kinsey... you.

507
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,962
[chuckles]

508
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,090
We all need to be protected.

509
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,551
Well, I certainly agree with that.

510
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,178
I want us all to be safe, too.

511
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,264
How can I help?

512
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,474
You can't understand. [sighs]

513
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,687
-Try me.
-[heavy exhale]

514
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,526
Do you remember when you were a kid?

515
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,238
Sure. A little, yeah.

516
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,992
Did you know Chamberlain?

517
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,995
Chamberlain?

518
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,830
Locke?

519
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,040
The old guy in the painting?

520
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:29,254
Well, no, he probably died
a hundred years ago.

521
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,675

[dog barks in distance]

700
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,321
Hello, Mrs. Locke.

701
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,406
Hey, Rufus.

702
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,116
Is your mom here?

703
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,910
I'm not supposed to tell strangers
when I'm home alone,

704
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,163
but you're a friend, so...

705
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,123
my mom isn't here.

706
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,211
Please tell her to call me
as soon as possible, okay?

707
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,504
I can do that.

708
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,965
Do you want me to tell her
that you seem upset?

709
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,426
No, not necessary.

710
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,972
[sighs] Hey, uh...

711
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:27,018
did you get that action figure
you left at my house?

712
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:32,773
No, ma'am.

713
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,152
All my troops are present
and accounted for.

714
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,239
Got it.

715
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,782
Thanks, Rufus.

720
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,763
Nina, hi. It's Joe.

721
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,308
Listen, I just saw something.
[stammers] I can't explain it.

722
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:08,976
Hey, I, um...

723
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,605
Listen, I think I need to show it to you,
all right?

724
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,398
I'm gonna be home all night.

725
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,696
[ringback tone]

726
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,867
Oh, come on, come on.

727
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,332
Tyler.

728
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,633
I've been waiting for you.

729
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:41,550
Tyler!

730
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,053
Jesus, Kinsey,
just give it a rest for tonight.

731
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,348
Tyler! Look, [sighs] I know things
aren't great with us right now,

732
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,851
-but I really--
-You told me to be done with you,

733
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,228
so I'm done.

734
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:54,772
I actually feel good for once,

735
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,607
so please just stay out of my hair.

736
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,277
Those kids that drowned in the cave
were Dad's friends.

737
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,778
His best friends.

738
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,863
Lucas, Jeff, and Kim.

739
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,741
-They'd all just graduated.
-[suspenseful instrumentals]

740
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,159
Dad never told us.

741
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,163
Maybe that's why
he never wanted to come back here.

742
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,083
Even if it meant abandoning the keys.

743
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,878
[hushed, indistinct whispering]

744
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,256
You hear that?

745
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,846
Seriously? You want to do this right now?

746
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,524
It's coming from outside.

747
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,987
-[door opens]
-[heavy sigh] Shit.

748
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,615
[gate squeaks open]

749
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,910
It's in here.

750
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,830
[Tyler] Perfect. [sighs]
This is going to be a fun key.

751
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,040
[whispering continues]

752
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,711
You know, we can just ignore it.

753
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,881
Ignore the magic
that's literally calling out for us

754
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:02,798
to find it?

755
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,634
Ever heard of a siren song?

756
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,636
[whispering intensifies]

757
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,349
[Kinsey] It's in here.

758
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,602
[vase rattles]

759
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,146

-Wait, you're not actually gonna--
-[shattering]

762
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,363
Unbelievable.

763
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,449
[whispering stops]

764
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,416
It looks like a starfish.

765
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,210
[Tyler sighs]

766
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,505
That's clearly a flower.

767
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,798
[dubious instrumentals]

768
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,424
I wonder where it goes.

769
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,552
Gee, maybe it's the, uh...
the glowing tree?

770
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,847
[Kinsey] We need to see what it does.

771
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,140
Actually, we don't.

772
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,061
-[sighs] I want you with me.
-[owl hoots]

773
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,901
These keys, they're our legacy.

774
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,906
And they're something
that connects us with Dad.

775
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,035
I think that means they're worth the risk.

776
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,749
And like you said,
the keys are weapons, too.

777
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,128
If we're somehow gonna have to fight
this Well Lady,

778
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,506
wouldn't it be smart for us to know
how they all work?

779
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,984
[key cranks]

780
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,238
[commotion and rumbling]

781
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,700
Kinsey?

782
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,617
Look.

783
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,079

-[whoos and laughing inside jar]
-[Kinsey] That's Dad flying.

788
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,238
They're memories.

789
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:34,783
Like in the candy boxes in my head,
but they're in paint jars.

790
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,578
Whose memories would be in paint jars?

791
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,750
[jar twinkles]

792
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,090
[Tyler] That's Dad and his friend Lucas.

793
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,512
[young Russell] Hey, Duncan,
what'd I say about snooping? Out, now.

794
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,680
[Kinsey] They're Duncan's memories.

795
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,560
[jar twinkles]

796
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,897
[jar twinkles]

797
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,275
Okay, show me how it works.

798
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,318
All you have to do

799
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,403
is think about
what you want to look like.

800
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,158

-[key crunches]

[whoosh]

802
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,122
And that's what you chose.

803
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,125
Oh, my God, Tyler.

804
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,127
You have to see this.

805
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,129
There's a key
that can change the way you look.

806
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,300
-What is it?
-[breathes shakily]

[crying out]

811
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,147
-The ones that drowned.
-[Kim] No, no, no!

812
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,482
What did you do?

813
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,317
Except obviously they didn't.

814
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,819
-[Kim cries]
-[young Duncan] Rendell?

815
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,407
Memories aren't perfect.

816
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,577
They're very subjective.

817
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,869
They're often distorted.

818
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,248
Does that...
does that look distorted to you?

819
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,624
[heavy breathing]

820
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,084
I can't believe this.

821
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,545
This isn't Dad.

822
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,589
He wouldn't even kill spiders
in the house!

823
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,591
He would never do something like this.

824
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:17,970
This is...

825
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,223
This is why
he didn't wanna come back here.

00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,191
[dubious instrumentals fade to silence]

Joe, it's Nina.

[woman] Nine-one-one,
what's your emergency?

844
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,726
[gasps, stammers] My friend's dead.
He's not breathing.

845
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,978
There was a plastic bag over his head.

-[gasping]
-Where are you now?

847
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,818
I'm at his house: 4020 Lowell Drive.
