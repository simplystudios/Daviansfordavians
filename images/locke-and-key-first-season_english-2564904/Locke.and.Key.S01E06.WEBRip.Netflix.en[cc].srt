Come on, Ellie, pick up.

7
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,365
Hey, it's Ellie. I'm not available
right now, but if you leave your name--

8
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,075
[Nina] Excuse me, how much longer?

9
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,536
Hmm. Should be just another five minutes.

10
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:38,913
You said that five minutes ago.

11
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,540
Hi there.

12
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,417
Sorry for the waiting.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,711
This department's not used
to handling much more

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,922
than the occasional noise complaint,
or petty theft, or van--

15
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,134
[exhales] Detective Daniel Matuko.

16
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,511
Nina Locke. I'm the one who found Joe.

17
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,930
-Yes, I know. I was--
-Can we talk in private?

18
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,932
Oh, sure. My office.

19
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,227
-Offer you some coffee or a fresh cruller?
-[receding footsteps]

20
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,270
No cruller.

21
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:06,900
Have a seat.

22
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,737
I'm very sorry about your friend.

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,574
I didn't know him very well,
but Joe was a beloved man in this town.

24
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,202
Which is why I wanted to speak to you
the other night at his house,

25
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,828
but they told me I had to wait.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,414
I was actually planning
on calling you today to follow-up.

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,459
-We're still investigating Joe's death.
-It wasn't suicide.

28
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,878
He wouldn't do that.

29
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,172
Like I said,
we're still investigating Joe's--

30
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,632
Joe was murdered.

31
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,635
What would make you think that?

32
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,222
When I was there, the door was unlocked.
[stammers] It was open.

33
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,474
Most of the doors in this town
are unlocked.

34
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,226
I heard someone in the house.

35
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,894
Did you see anyone?

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,939
Any evidence
that says somebody else was there?

37
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,065
Well, no, no, but...

38
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,276
he left me a voicemail
an hour before I found him.

39
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,779
Hi, Nina, it's Joe.

40
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,239
I, uh--

41
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,366
[sighs] I just saw something.

42
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,077
But I can't explain it.

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,704
I think I just need to show you,
I'll be home all night.

44
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,789
-[beep]
-What do you think

45
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,541
-he planned on showing you?
-I have no idea.

46
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,502
But that's not the message someone leaves
who's about to kill themselves.

47
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,547
Joe had absolutely no reason
to commit suicide.

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,881
I saw him that night.

49
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,843
He wasn't upset about anything.
If anything, I was the one who was upset.

50
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,261
About what?

51
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,389
You might've heard that I... [sighs]

52
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,974
I lost my husband recently

53
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,726
and Joe was helping me...

54
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,062
try to make sense of it.

55
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,023
Listen...

56
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,319
I don't want to sound dismissive,
but I've got to go with the evidence.

57
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,156
And the evidence
strongly points toward suicide.

58
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,366
-That said,
-[heavy sigh]

59
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,952
we will take everything
under consideration.

60
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,412
What about Ellie Whedon?

61
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,454
Have you talked to her?

62
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,040
Sorry, Mrs. Locke,
I can't give you any more details.

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,508
Is this Joe's?

64
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,509
Yeah, we found that

65
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,510
on his desk

66
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,220
in his home office.

67
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,222
He said he had to show me something.

68
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,726
-It could've been something in this box.
-I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

69
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,730
But you have my word, I will be in touch
as soon as I know more.

70
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:11,983
[Nina sighs]

71
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,197
[receding footsteps]

72
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,495
[Duncan] Rendell, no!

73
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,830
[whacking]

74
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,209

75
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,005
[key rattles]

76
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,340
So crazy, right?

77
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,091
We just saw him

78
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,593
and now he's gone.

79
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,221
[mellow instrumentals]

80
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,515
[Tyler] You never know
what's going on in someone's brain.

81
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,352
That's true.

82
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,688
Hey... do you still wanna come over later?

83
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,024
Yeah, of course.

84
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,401
Okay.

85
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,830
[Scot] Okay, so we have a big problem.

86
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,708
-The climactic demise of Nephropidae.
-[door closes]

87
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,002
The first cut came out a bit rubbish.

88
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,754
What, don't think we cracked the lobster?

89
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,256
-[laughing]
-[Scot] Good one.

90
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,633
But it's not all bad news, however.

91
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,678
-I found another solution.
-And by "I," you mean--

92
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,595
[Scot] We, sorry.

93
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,055
None of this would've been possible

94
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,807
without the brilliant Kinsey Locke.

95
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm sorry, none of what, exactly?

96
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,020
Oh, I've written a few extra scenes

97
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,398
that I really think
will make this thing sing,

98
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,983
and Kinsey and I have already shot one.

99
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,234
[birds chirping]

100
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:39,279
And how's that?
All the equipment's in my van.

101
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,239
[stammers] Well, we...

102
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,991
Kinsey had a work around.

103
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,327
-[phone chimes]
-[Douglas] Shit.

104
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,371
What is it?

105
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,039
[sighs] We lost the Matheson Docks.

106
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,084
-As in they... they sunk?
-[Douglas] As in Mr. Peña,

107
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,836
the owner,
won't let us film there.

108
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,212
Why not?

109
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,340
He doesn't wanna deal
with potential liability... Blah, blah.

110
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,884
See, there's a reason
no one wants to shoot in Matheson.

111
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,678
This town is so not ready
for it's big break.

112
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,513
[groans] Okay, it's fine. It's okay.

113
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,307
We will find something else, all right?

114
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,391
We have to, okay?

115
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,226
This is the pivotal scene.

116
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,561
This is our hero's epic showdown

117
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,771
with Nephropidae inside his lair, okay?

118
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,400
Let's think on it and regroup tomorrow,

119
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,318
all right?

00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,485
He's hanging at his girlfriend's tonight.

131
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,322
[scoffs] Gone for a few weeks
and I miss all the hot goss.

132
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,532
Whatcha got there?

133
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,285
I want to show you something.

134
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,499
Does it bother you that you don't remember
pieces of your childhood?

135
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,086
[clicks tongue]
I don't really think about it.

136
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,756
I think your brain forgets old memories
to make space for new ones.

137
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,591
What do you want to show me?

What are those?

141
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,772
They're memories.

142
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,316
I think they're your memories.

143
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,485
Well, how did they make...

144
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,070
Who made these?

145
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,905
I know this won't make any sense, but...

146
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,242
I think someone took them
out of your head.

147

[twinkles]

149
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,917
I wanted you to look at them
to see if you remember

150
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,835
anything about them.

151
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,046
Duncan?

152
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,298
What is it? What do you see?

[breathes heavily]

154
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,263
Feels so familiar, but I...

155
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,100
I don't know what I'm looking at.

00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,905
I'm sorry. This was a bad idea.

-[clanking and zipping]
-What was a bad idea?

161
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,121
[Nina] Dunc?
Can you give me a hand with dinner?

162
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,289
Yeah, I'll be right there.

163
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,748
Excuse me.

Hey.

00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,308
You good?

169
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,225
Yeah.

170
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,478
You've been staring at that same photo
of a coelacanth

171
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,897
for an hour and I'm just wondering
if I should be jealous.

172
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,441
Just... something on my mind.

173
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:04,942
Like what?

174
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:05,943
[whacks book shut]

175
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:10,156
What I would rather be doing
instead of homework.

you were rocking some bling

00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,873
under there.

180
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,584
-Sort of.
-I didn't mean to embarrass you.

181
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,169
No, no, you didn't. Um...

182
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,505
I just...

183
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,966
I should get going, actually.

184
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,385
Sorry, did I do something wrong?

185
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,723
Oh, no, not at all.
I just, uh... lost track of the time.

186
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,808
-You're sure?
-Yeah, of course.

187
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,227
[zipping and rustling]

188
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,062
Okay, but you'll be there Sunday, right?

189
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,688
Set-up's at two.

190
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,357
Yeah, definitely.

191
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:45,942
[kisses]

192
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,156
-[door squeaks open]
-[descending footsteps]

193
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,575
[door closes]

194
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,370
I have to show you something.

195
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,788
Can't it wait?

196
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,165
No, it really can't.

197
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,793
[ascending footsteps]

198
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,970
I tried talking to Duncan
about what happened with Dad.

199
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,431
I even tried showing him his memories,
but it didn't work.

200
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,724
[crickets chirp]

201
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,519
Adults can't remember magic.
We already know this.

202
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,521
And by the way, you shouldn't be
doing that shit

203
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,897
without us talking first.

204
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,568
But it wasn't like
what happened with Mom, though.

205
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,861
Even while he was watching the memory,
it was like,

206
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,030
his brain couldn't process it
or something.

207
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,615
My brain can barely process it.

208
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,785
But there was one memory
he totally fixated on.

209
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,291
-[bag hums]
-[items clank]

210
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,337

[indistinct chatter]

213
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,264
What am I looking at?

214
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,434
[Kinsey] That's Dad and his friends
going down into the caves.

215
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,519
[curious instrumentals]

216
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,980
Look at this next part.

217
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,649
-[low humming]
-See that blue light?

218
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,696
Something happened to Dad and his friends
in that sea cave.

219
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,072
I want to go down there.

220
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,117
By yourself,
to chase after some weird blue light?

221
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,202
I'm not gonna go by myself.

222
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,746
[lid clanks]

223
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,414
I'm asking you to come with me.

224
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:28,753
No.

225
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,672
We don't know
what we saw in that memory, Tyler.

226
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,549
We don't know what Dad did!

227
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,635
Sure seems like he killed his friend.

228
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,552
It was a moment.

229
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,304
We don't know
what happened before.

230
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,889
Or after!

231
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,182
If we go down to the caves,

232
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,017
-maybe we can get some answers.
-Kinsey, stop.

233
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,894
-Our Dad's not a murderer!
-[yelling] Kinsey!

234
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,439
[breathes heavily]

235
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,193
I'm done with this.

236
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,070
-Meaning what?
-It means...

237
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,237
[stammers] I'm done.

238
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,491
I'm done with Dad,
I'm done with these evil keys!

239
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,700
[key thuds and rattles]

240
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,952
They're all yours.

241
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,837
[birds chirping]

242
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,924
[solemn instrumentals]

00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,388
[hushed chatter]

244
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,705
Why are you avoiding me?

245
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,625
Nina, this isn't the time or the place.

246
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,711
You should've picked up one of my calls.

247
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,212
You're hiding something.

248
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,550
Outside, now.

249
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,637
What do you want from me, Nina?

250
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,599
You and Rendell have the exact same scar.

251
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,977
I know you didn't get it
from a bike accident.

252
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,770
That's what this is about?

253
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,896
How'd you get it?

254
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,814
[Ellie scoffs]

255
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,360
We did it to ourselves,

256
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,695
okay?

257
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,322
Me, Rendell, Mark and Erin...

258
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,659
senior year after our friends died,

259
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,703
we pressed a hot poker to our chests.

260
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,663
It was a way to remember them.

261
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,041
Well, why wouldn't you have just
told me that when I asked?

262
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,877
Because it was none of your business,

263
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,836
that's why!

264
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,299
[stammers, sighs] It was a private,
intimate thing.

265
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,427
-Now, if you'll excuse me.
-The night Joe died, where were you?

266
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,637
[scoffs]

267
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,765
[stammers] I was home.

268
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,057
No, you weren't.

269
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,143
I went to your house and talked to Rufus

270
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,479
right before I went to Joe's.

271
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,647
You weren't there.

272
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,780
What exactly are you accusing me of, Nina?
Just say it.

273
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,115
Look... [stammers] I cared about Joe.

274
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,243
Twenty-five years, Nina,
that's how long I've known Joe.

275
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,330
You've been in town all of what,
a few months?

276
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,333
So don't talk to me about caring for Joe.

277
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,460
[dubious instrumentals]

278
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,505
I tried really hard to be your friend.

[Zadie scoffs] Wow.

00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,151
[Kinsey screams on screen]

283
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,487
[Zadie] How the hell did you do that?

284
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,364
[stammers] It's a...

285
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,907
time lapse effect.

286
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,035
-[continued screaming]
-Yeah, great work, guys. It's magical.

287
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,621
[Douglas] I mean, yeah, it's cool,

288
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,581
but let me be the one
to state the obvious here,

289
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,167
I mean, what's Nephropidae doing
chasing Amanda through the woods?

290
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,293
He's a sea monster.

291
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,212
[sighs] We've been over this,
Douglas, okay?

292
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,005
He's both water and land based.

293
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,006
No?

294
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,968
Look, what we really need
to be focusing our energy on

295
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,219
is finding a new location

296
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,638
for our final showdown. Okay? Now,

297
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,639
there are no bad ideas.

298
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:09,723
-Go.
-We could build one.

299
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,141
With what budget?

300
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,186
We could construct miniatures
and then film it in bathtubs.

301
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,897
I stand corrected,
there are definitely bad ideas.

302
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,233
-I thought this was a safe place.
-Well, I'm sorry Douglas,

303
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,235
but we're making a monster piece here.

304
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,486
I have an idea.

305
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,572
What if we shoot
in the sea caves?

306
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,448
Uh...

307
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,535
[laughs] I don't think that's a good idea.

308
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,247
You know that they're nicknamed
the "Drowning Caves" for a reason?

309
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,000
It's really not that scary
as long as you're careful.

310
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,587
I've been down there before,
it's insanely cool!

311
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,339
No, it would be a bitch
to get all our equipment down there, so--

312
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,508
There are rumors
that place was like a government site.

313
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,720
What if there's radiation or something?
I don't want to grow a third arm.

314
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,097
You guys are being such killjoys
right now. Come on!

315
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,599
I actually love this idea.

316
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,976
[laughs] I mean,
where's your sense of adventure?

317
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,437
Yeah, you said yourself,
you don't want it to look like

318
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,814
some cheap, hacky, home-made film, right?

319
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,400
Well, obviously.

320
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,153
Okay, unless someone's got a better idea,
I vote sea caves.

321
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,196
[distant chatter]

322
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,785
All right, sea caves. Let's do it.

[latch clicks]

332
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,664

Whoa.

It looks just like our world.

341
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,087
Morning, kiddo.

342
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,007
Want some cereal? [gasps]

343
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,884
You found the key!

344
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,260
That's great.

345
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,556
I found that cabinet in the basement
a few weeks ago.

346

-There's nothing magical about it.
-Well, not yet.

347
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,395

349
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,941
do we have any flashlights?

Mm...

351
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,402
Try the closet upstairs.

352
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,404
What do you need them for?
