00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,298
Can everyone see that?

00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,509
[hushed chatter]

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,886
Okay, so what you don't wanna do here

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,806
is you do not wanna cut
the underlying organs,

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:19,394
so you are going to lift
the umbilical cord as you cut.

6
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:23,314
So now that you have the skin flaps there,
you're gonna wanna pin them down

7
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,108
with your dissecting pins,

8
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,986
which I'm clearly out of at the moment.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,114
Okay, pin those flaps. I'll be right back.

10
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,615
[indistinct chatter]

11
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:35,618

-Sam!
-[ominous instrumentals]

26
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,823
Sam.

27
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,034
Come on...

28
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,455
[door closes]

29
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,332
[Rendell] Have a seat.

30
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,127
[chair scrapes floor]

31
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,505
"Jingle Bells," huh?

32
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,007
Um... Well,

33
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,136
Principal Westmore wants three weeks
of after-school detention.

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,096
Three weeks?

35
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,640
Your last incident
wasn't even a week ago, Sam.

36
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,141
You're...

37
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,018
lucky it's not worse.

38
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,231
People were laughing
and I guess I got carried away.

39
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,398
I'm sorry, Mr. Locke.

40
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,860
Bud, you're not the first person
to seek the approval of others.

41
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,403
It happens.

42
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,907
But lately, it feels like
you're getting carried away a lot.

43
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,535
What's going on?

44
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,871
I don't know.

45
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,582
How are things at home?

46
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,211
[deep breath] Not the best,
but I dunno. It's okay.

47
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,171
Look...

48
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,137
[deep breath] Sam... [slow exhale]

49
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,721
I have been in your shoes.

50
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,056
I screwed up a lot

51
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,015
in the past.

52
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,520
I know what it's like,
and I wanna help you.

53
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,231
You do?

54
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,233
Yeah.

55
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,696
You mentioned trying for vocational school
after graduation.

56
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:35,989
I did a little digging.

57
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,699
[Dodge whispers] Sam!

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,827
[Rendell] And I found a few programs at...

59
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,831
-[Dodge whispers] Sam!
-[Rendell continues indistinctly]

60
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,592
[Dodge] I see you, Sam.

61
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,510
[Rendell] How's that sound?

62
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:05,643
What's that place?

63
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,979
[Rendell] Uh...

64
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,566
That's my family's home in Massachusetts.

65
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,364
[Sam] It's cool.

66
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,908
You grew up in that house?

67
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,869
[Rendell] It's been in the family
for a very long time.

68
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,829
This etching...

69
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,458
it reminds me where I came from.

70
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,879
Helps me appreciate where I am.

[Kinsey] Sally.

81
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,349
I totally forgot about this.

82
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm worried about what the Well Lady said.

83
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,103
I think we should call Tyler.

84
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,731
I lost my phone down in the caves.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,607
The sea caves?

86
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,985
Yeah, me and some friends
were trying to shoot some stuff

87
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:19,944
for our film.

88
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,783

101
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,546
[Nina] Kinsey?

102
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,755
Tyler?

103
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,939
[distant footsteps]

104
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,658
All right,
I think this is the last of my stuff.

105
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,078
We should get Mom's phone
to check on Tyler and see if he's safe.

106
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,247
Okay. If you're that worried.

107
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,708
[crickets chirping]

108
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:28,925
[Kinsey] Shit.

109
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,470
Why would Well Lady break a window?

110
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,348
She can come and go
from any door in the house.

111
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,977
[suspenseful instrumentals continue]

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,355
[Bode] Maybe it's not Well Lady.

113
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,023
[Kinsey] Then who is it?

114
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,994
[instrumentals intensify]

115
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,037

-Hey there, Mrs. Locke.

118
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,129
I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't scream.

00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,258
-[Nina] Please don't hurt us.
-[Sam] Shut your mouth.

120
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,926
I want you to go hide.

121
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,177
What are you gonna do?

122
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,595
I can't just leave Mom.

123
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,557
I've got a better idea.

124
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,225
[Bode exhales]

125
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,769
Just don't freak out
when you see my body, okay?

126
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,979
What happens to your body?

127
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,022
I don't know. It just kinda looks weird.

128
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,274
Like what?

129
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,442
Like a sock without a foot in it.

130
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,361
Or like I'm dead.

131
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,197
Just guard my body, okay?

132
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,116
And keep the door open.

133
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,036

00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,799
Holy crap!

[exhales in awe]

144
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,617
Mom?

Mom?

146
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,371
Mom?

147
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,999
[Nina] I really don't know
what you're talking about.

148
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,335
-[whoosh]
-[Sam] Where are they?

149
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,503
-[Bode gasps]
-How did you get out?

150
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,505
-I escaped.
-[Bode yells] Hey!

151
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,257
There was a small fire.

152
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,551
-Then a friend helped me get here.
-[yelling] Mom!

153
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,638
Why did you come here?

154
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,222
To get the Head Key.

155
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,183
I'm sorry?

156
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,184
The Head Key?

157
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,353
One of the special keys.
Don't act like you don't know.

158
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,606
Does this have something to do
with Rendell?

159
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,523
Don't lie to me!

160
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,359
I'm not lying about anything.

161
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,402
[stammers] I want to help you.

162
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,738
I just don't know
what you're talking about.

163
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,948
The kids will know. Where are they?

164
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:02,203
Sam. Please, Sam.
They won't know anything about anything--

165
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,329
Shut up.

166
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,664
-[Sam] Let's go.
-Mom!

167
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,332
I'm gonna go get help.

[twinkling]

169
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,419
Are you okay?

170
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,713
-It's Sam Lesser.
-What?

171
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,758
He's got Mom... and a gun,
and he says he wants the Head Key.

172
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,387
-How does he know about the Head Key?
-I don't know, but he's here.

173
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,441
[tearing]

174
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,403
[Bode] What are you doing?

175
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,445
Improvising.

176
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,407
Let's go.

177
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,909
[Nina gasps]

178
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,578
Hey, Kinsey. Hey, Bode.

179
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,291
Let her go.

180
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,876
Yeah, totally. I can do that.

181
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,461
We can all be friends.

182
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,797
Just give me the Head Key.

183
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,550

00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,586
Give it back.

365
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,004
Now.

366
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,969
[dog barks in the distance]

367
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,848
Why don't you just take it from me?

373

[clock ticks faintly]

379
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,520
[Sam] What do you have for dessert?

380
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,232
Hope you're not one
of those sugar-free mothers.

381
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,901
-[tense instrumentals]
-[Nina] There's popsicles and ice cream

382
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,819
in the freezer.

383
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,903
[Sam] In prison,

384
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,280
I had this caramel custard thing.

385
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,906
That was really good.

386
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,284
-[grunting and thudding]
-Get him, Ty!

387
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,952

[grunting and struggling]

392
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,132
[Sam gasps for air]

393
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,971
[flames roar]

394
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,056

-[Tyler] No!
-[Nina gasps]

397
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,396
[heavy breathing]

398
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:38,982
Quite the greeting, Ty.

399
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,068
But I'm glad you're here.

400
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,027
I need the Head Key.

401
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,029
What?

402
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,655
[yelling] The Head Key! Now!

403
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,199
-I've been waiting!
-I don't have it!

404
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:48,116
[Sam] Bullshit!

405
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,201
[gun clicks]

406
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,286
Sam!

407
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,413
You have three chances
to give me the right answer.

408
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,541
-[Tyler] Sam!
-Tell him, Kinsey. Now!

409
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,959
Tyler doesn't have it!

410
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,670
Of course you lied.

411
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,464
-[Nina exhales]
-Where is it?

412
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,465
I buried it.

413
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:04,925
Out in the woods.

414
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,927
Why would you bury it in the woods?

415
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,345
Because it's dangerous!

416
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,472
And we knew somebody might want it.

417
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,932
[Tyler breathes heavily]

418
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,394
Why should I believe
a word you're saying right now?

419
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,941
Because I don't want you to hurt
anybody else in my family.

420
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,611
-[gun clicks]
-Well, then...

421
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,739
you, me and Bode
are gonna go dig it up.

[keys rattle]

425
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,171
-Sam? Sam. I'll go with you.
-[Sam] You're not going anywhere.

426
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,257
-Take me instead.
-Shut up!

427
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,467
I don't need either of you.

428
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,763
-[Kinsey] Bode doesn't need to come.
-[clears throat] Sure he does.

429
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,099
He's my collateral.

430
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,225
[chair thuds]

431
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,810
Right, little buddy?

432
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,770
[Nina] Sam,

433
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,147
if you harm my children,

434
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,023
you will wish I only had a hammer.

435
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,109
-[chair thuds]
-Do you understand me?

436
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,904
Such a spitfire.

437
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,947
[chair scrapes]

438
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,908
That's exactly why I'm taking them
and not you.

439
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,368
Let's go.

440
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,578
[chairs scrapes]

441
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,251
If something happens to me,

442
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,045
remember to take care of Sally.

443
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,883
[Nina] Sam!

444
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,092
Please!

445
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,848
-[crickets chirp]
-[insects trill]

446
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:36,975
[Kinsey] So,

447
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,352
what happens when Dodge
or whatever opens the black door?

448
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,480
-[vegetation crunching under steps]
-Shut up and walk.

449
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,065
I bet you don't even know
why you're doing this,

450
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,193
-do you?
-I said be quiet!

451
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,528
You can't trust her.

452
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,155
All she does is lie to make you do stuff

453
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,406
you shouldn't do.

454
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,783
She lied to me and now she's lying to you.

455
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,995
-[lantern thuds]
-Spoken as the son of a liar.

456
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:58,955
So... [clicks pen]

457
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,542
-how have the past few weeks gone?
-[deep breath] Good.

458
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,419
Really good actually.

459
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,547
I don't know if Tyler told you,
but him and I have been hanging out some.

460
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,552
Well, that is, uh... [chuckles]

461
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,429
that is good to hear, Sam.

462
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,765
-And class is going okay?
-Yeah.

463
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,475
How are things on the home front?

464
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,770
-[phone rings]
-Hold that thought.

465
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,230
Hey.

466
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,441
[sharp inhale] Oh, uh...
Yeah, hold on a sec.

467
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,318
Yeah, tell him I'll be right there.

468
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,361
Okay, thanks.

469
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,488
-[receiver clanks]
-I'll be right back. Hang tight.

470
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,908
[door opens and closes]

471
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,169
[Dodge] Sam?

472
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,381
Sam?

473
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,927
[approaching footsteps]

-[ominous instrumentals]
-You don't have to be afraid.

475
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,060
What are you?

476
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,603
I'm your friend.

477
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,397
I...

478
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,440
Or at least I want to be.

479
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,570
Look on the desk, Sam.

480
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:14,906
Just look.

481
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,452
[picture rattles on desk]

482
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:25,959
Open it.

[pages rustling]

484
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,733
They're not your real friends, Sam.

485
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,401
They lie to you.

486
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,237
-[gasps]
-You're nothing more than a virus to them.

487
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:56,615
But me...

488
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,659
I would never lie to you, Sam.

489
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,370
'Cause I know how special you are.

490
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,413
[yelling] Stop!

491
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,708
This isn't real!

492
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,209
Yes, it is, Sam.

493
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,004
And I know how to get you what you want.

494
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,674
You just have to listen to me, okay?

495
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,551
Just listen.

496
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,847
[indistinct chatter]

497
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,098
[girl] Whoa...

This is the spot.

501
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,358
Sit.

[shovel thuds]

523

You do know
that if there's no Head Key down there,

524
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,128
I'm gonna have to kill both of you.

525
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,630

Really?

530
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,813
That was your plan?
