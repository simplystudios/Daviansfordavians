Ready with the celery?

00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,527
Ready.

9
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,904
This was a great idea, Rufus.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,699
I think Nina and the kids
are really gonna like it.

11
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,534
A good meal is important after a battle.

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,411
Right.

[upstairs commotion]

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,085
How much longer is he going to stay here?

15

[Ellie] Not much longer.

16
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,505
[Rufus] Not to break rank,

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,591
but you said that two weeks ago.

18
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,384
I need you to hang in there.

19
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,678
You remember the rule, right?

20
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,389
We can't let anyone know he's here.

No breakfast?

24
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,283
We're making a soup
to take over to the Lockes.

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,453
Figured it was the least we could do.

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,205
Terrible what happened to them.

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,999
The kid that showed up,

28
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,376
it was the same kid
that murdered Rendell, right?

00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,088
Talk about a dog with a bone.

30
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:32,592
Rufus, will you go down and see if we have
another can of tomatoes, please?

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,267
Where were you last night?

32
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,771
Did you somehow have a hand
in this, Lucas?

33
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,857
If anyone had a hand in what happened
at Key House...

34
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,318
it was you, Ellie.

00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:57,325

Is it weird that when you die...

00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,708
almost die,

40

41
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,545
[Kinsey] Totally.

42
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,505
I guess it's nice that people care.

43
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,799
Yeah. I'm sure they're all super stoked

44
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,384
that we lured a psychotic killer

45
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,718
into their nice little town.

46
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,761

I don't know.

51
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,066
How messed up this all is?

52
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,111
Dodge is the reason Dad's dead

53
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,362
and she got what she wanted.

54
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,823
She got the Head Key.

55
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,450
Sam said she's gonna use it
to try and open the black door.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,119
Black door?

57
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,537
Yeah, it's in the sea caves.

58
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,209
My friends and I went down there
to film our movie.

59
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,211
I was checking the caves out

60
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,255
and found the door, way in the back.

61
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,715
I know you told me not to.

62
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,800
-[chair backs rattle]
-So, what's behind it?

63
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:57,927
I don't know.

64
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,596
-I didn't know how to open it.
-[inhales]

65
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,056
That's why Dodge wanted the Head Key.

66
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,684
Somebody has this information
in their brain.

67
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,811
Okay.

68
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,314
Who?

69
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,690
One of Dad's old friends?

70
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,026
I mean we know they used the keys

71
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,028
and they went down to the sea caves
at least once.

72
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,322
-I want to see it.
-I'm not sure

73
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,531
that's a good idea.

74
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,201
We lost track of time down there
and then the ocean came in.

75
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,702
We almost drowned.

76
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,416
Two fifteen is low tide.

77
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,919
[scoffs] You should've come with me
the first time.

78
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,839
Oh, my gosh! [laughs]

79
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,549
Look at all this stuff.

80
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,718
Yeah. Random people
have been dropping stuff off

81
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,845
-all morning.
-So nice that they care.

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,974
Mm! That is pretty good.

84
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,435
And you guys are cleaning!

85
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,104
Thanks so much, guys, for chipping in!

86
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,483
Why don't I go get started on the study?

[Nina exhales]

88
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,074

00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,086
Mom?

92
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,254
[louder] Mom?

-[vacuum powers down]
-Sorry. [chuckles]

94
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,175
I thought I could save it,

95
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,426
but it's a goner.

96
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,469

97
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,971
[Nina groans]

98
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,138
[Tyler] Here, I can help.

99
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,267
It's fine! It's done. See?

100
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,268
[Nina sighs]

101
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,647
Oh.

102
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:34,524
Oh, honey.

103
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,693
You being back in this room, it...

104
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,444
it must be...

105
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,281
[sharp inhale] Hey...

106
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,200
what you did to Sam...

107
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,619
you had to.

108
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,622
It was self defense.
You saved our whole family.

109
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,625
I don't want you to ever think
that you didn't do the right thing.

110
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,295
And if you want to talk
about anything that happened,

111
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,547
I'm here for you.

112
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,841
If you don't, that's okay, too.

113
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:00,800
Do you?

114
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,385
Mom? [stammers]

115
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,847
Want to talk about it?

116
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,890
Any of it?

117
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,892
I'm okay.

118
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,270
But no emotion is wrong here.

119
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,441
You should feel
however feels right to you, okay?

120
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,192
Okay?

121
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,320
Okay.

122
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,321
Good.

124
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,867
[Nina] Oh.

125
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,202
I decided to move that old cabinet
in here.

126
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,455
Gives the room a whole different energy.

127
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,957
I might make some more changes
in here, too.

128
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,918
What the hell?

[tense instrumentals]

130
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,007
Come on.

131
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,384
What are you doing?

132
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,761
Looking for her stash.

133
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,555
-[rustling]
-She's clearly drinking again.

134
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,974
She's acting a little off.

135
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,810
We're all a little off right now.
It doesn't mean she's drinking.

136
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,229
Kinsey, you know the cycle.
First, she gets all happy,

137
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,107
carefree, then she'll get weird
and emotional for a while,

138
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,985
and after that, she'll just... shut down,

139
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,487
won't get out of her bed.

140
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,491
Don't tell me
you don't remember how this goes.

141
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,284
Of course I remember. I'm just saying--

142
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,702
-[door closes]
-Spearmint.

143
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,746
I smelled it on her breath.

144
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,164
She reeks of it.

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,875
-[drawer opens]
-[hushed] Shit.

146
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,293
Can't say I'm surprised.

147
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,545
Nothing that's been going on
makes any sense to her.

148
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,130
Is it our fault?

149
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,509
[drawer closes]

150
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,927
That we've been lying to her,

151
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,513
about the keys, about everything Sam said.

152
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,474
I dunno. I just... [sighs]
I just wanna find the booze

153
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,975
and throw it out.

00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,447
What are you guys doing?

156
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,740
Nothing.

157
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,076
-Uh...
-We're just helping Mom.

158
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,161
Yeah, she, um...

159
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,746
she lost her phone, so...

160
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,833
What are we gonna do about Dodge?

161
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,501
She took all our keys.

162
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,837
You know what? Letting us handle it
right now is helpful.

163
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,048
Come on. Let's go downstairs.

164
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,427
I'll make you chocolate chip pancakes.
Hmm?

-Detective.

-Did you forget something?
-No.

170

I just wanted to check in on you.

171
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,151
Not in an official capacity,
just as a Matheson neighbor

172
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,069
seeing how you're holding up.

173
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,655
Hope that's okay.

174
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,407
Of course. Come on in.

No, thank you.

How about something to eat?

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,463
You'd be helping me out.

-we've got too much of it.
-[chuckles]

183

Right.

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,888
The blessing and the curse
of living in a small town.

185
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,599
Everybody knows everything,

186
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,935
and most people
like to show their concern with food.

187
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:58,895
For sure.

188
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,813
You should see the collection.

189
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,149
Now, if Vincenzo shows up
with his lasagna--

190
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,650
I should call you?

191
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,279
You should consider that lasagna
the bright side

192
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,531
of an otherwise terrible situation.

193
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,496
[Nina slurps from mug]

194
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,417
You know, you could go anywhere.

195
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,837
Maybe getting out of town
would do you guys some good.

196
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,008
My brother-in-law Duncan offered us
his place up in Boston, but...

197
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,554
I think we're better off here.

198
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,974
Getting back to normal. [sighs heavily]

199
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,478
We're fine. [takes a breath]

[Daniel inhales slowly]

203
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,534
If you ever want to talk...

204
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,828
I know we don't know each other very well,

205
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,373
but sometimes that helps. I can be--

206
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,583
Thank you, Daniel.

207
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
Right.

208
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,509
Well, you've got my number
in case you need anything.

209
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,345
Either police-related or otherwise.

210
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,475
Take care, Nina.

211
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,478

-Oh, yeah,

I'm fine.

Why are you following me?

243
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,311
It's Jackie. She just texted.

244
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,064
Then why does she need to ring the bell?

245
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,440
-Hi.
-Hey, Kinsey.

246
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,734
-Did you guys carpool?
-[Gabe] No,

247
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,111
actually, we just, um...

248
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,445
We randomly got here

249
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,988
at the exact same time. [laughs]

254
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,125
Looks like you're not hurting
for comfort food.

255
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,876
No, this is... this is great.

256
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,922

Hi, I'm Nina.

I'm Jackie. It's so nice to meet you.

I just wish it was another time,

262
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,766
you know, different circumstances.

263
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,102
People come into our lives
exactly when they should.

[Nina inhales sharply]

265
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,980
Or so they say. [chuckles]

-Hi, I'm Gabe.
-[Nina] Hi, Gabe.

267
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,191
So...

268
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,653
do I have you two to blame for the fact
that I hardly ever see my kids?

269
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,947

-Maybe?

I'm joking!

272
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,745
I'm thrilled
that you guys are forming relationships.

273
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,248
-Mom!
-Oh, I'm not talking about romantic ones.

274
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,710
I mean, my God, I... [laughs]
I don't even pretend to know,

275
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,962
but friendships, friendships...

276
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,839
are the...

277
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,509
foundation that we stand on.
I really believe that.

278
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,389
I'll just say they're lucky
to have you guys.

279
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,725
Really! [laughs]

280
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,269
Especially given recent events.

281
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,939
Yeah, well, [laughs] we like hanging out
with them, too, so...

Mm! Don't be strangers, okay?

284
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,697
This is as close as we'll get
to attending our own funerals.

You wanna go somewhere and talk?

Hi.

292
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,100
Rufus,

293
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,478
do you want to go and find Bode?

294
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,647
-I think he's upstairs in his room.
-Ten-four, ma'am.

297
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:42,905
Thanks.

298
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,660
When I heard what happened to you guys,
I just felt sick.

299
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,703
Especially after Joe's memorial.

300
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,747
I am so sorry, Nina. I really am.

301
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,665
Don't be.

302
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,874
You were hurting

303
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,960
and I was interrogating you...

304
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,504
-I should've been more understanding.
-...and for what?

305
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,381
[stammers] I was just trying...

306
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,842
[sighs] I don't know.

307
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,387
Have you ever had that experience
in life, where...

308
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,930
[heartfelt instrumentals]

309
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,808
it just doesn't make any kind of sense
and...

310
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,270
you're so angry
about why things are the way they are?

311
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,229
[chuckles]

312
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,191
Yeah. I have.

313
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,610
You wanna come in?

314
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,071
-Yes.
-[laughs]

315
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,742
I want to apologize...

316
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,746
for bailing on the 5k and...

317
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,000
at that party...

318
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,919
I was a dick.

319
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,964
I shouldn't have left.

320
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,384
It really hurt me.

321
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,512
I'm so sorry.

322
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,851
I know.

323
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,939
Don't do it again.

324
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,114
Ellie?

325
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,909
[gasps] Kinsey. [sighs]

326
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,453
I'm so glad you guys are all okay.

327
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,370
Thanks.

328
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,416
Is everything okay with you?

-[tense instrumentals]
-Me?

330
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,713
Sure, why?

331
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,715
You haven't been approached
by anyone strange?

332
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,384
An unusual visitor?

333
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,471
Um--

334
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,473
Like say a very pretty girl

335
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,016
about yea high, dark hair?

336
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,936
[deep exhale] No.

337
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,479
Haven't seen anyone like that.

338
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,856
Okay. Good.

339
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,858
Okay.

340
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,612
[laughs] You have to take, like,
four casseroles with you.

341
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,572
[laughs] Do you have Vincenzo's lasagna?

342
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,616
Sadly, no.

00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,743
-[kisses]
-I should get back up to Gabe.

[Bode] Mom! Mom!

345
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:57,957
[Nina] Aw...

346
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,377
Did you know
that Rufus has a P51 D Mustang?

347
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,420
-That's a car?
-An aircraft.

348
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,421
A model airplane.

349
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,757
Bode wants to come over
and work on it with me.

350
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,467
Yeah. If it's okay.

351
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,052
[Nina] Yeah, it sounds like fun.

352
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,846
Well, if that's okay with you, of course.

353
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,100
Might do him some good, you know,
to get out of the house for a bit.

354
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,435
Sure. Of course.

355
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,729
-Thanks, Mom.
-Have fun.

356
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,106
-Thanks, Ellie.
-[Ellie] Sure.

357
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,857
[Bode] Come on, Rufus! [mimics airplane]

358
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,573
Hey,

359
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,283
you got into Parsons, that's awesome.

360
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
Oh, yeah. [laughs] Thanks.

361
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,747
I wasn't snooping by the way.
That was just like sitting there.

362
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,832
It's fine.

363
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,711
Well, you don't seem very excited
about it. [chuckles]

364
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,672
Yeah, I dunno. I used to think I would be.

365
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,174
Should I be?

366
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,927
[scoffs] I'm not going to tell you
how to feel.

367
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,097
-That's very smart of you.
-Mm.

368
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,392
Although, if I was speaking selfishly,

369
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,436
I can't say that I'd be thrilled

370
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,689
at the idea of you being away
the whole summer.

371
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,274
No?

372
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,778
Well, I think you'd be the only one
who'd miss me. [chuckles]

373
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,155
What? That's not true.

374
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,198
-You're the only one who's here, Gabe.
-[laughs]

375
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,119
Okay, Doug and Zadie,
they wanted to be here, okay?

376
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,204
[stammering]
And I haven't talked to Scot yet,

377
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,122
but I'm sure--

378
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,540
They're all still mad at me.

379
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,458
I get that.

380
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,084
I deserve it.

381
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:27,087
No, but I think they're all just
a little freaked out. I mean...

382
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,882
It's kinda crazy
what happened to you and your family.

383
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,717
Yeah, no shit.

384
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,845
When I heard that guy came back...

385
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,306
[scoffs] who does that?

386
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,476
What did he want? Was he after revenge?

387
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,689
What does my family have
that no one else in the world does?

388
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,524
-Like 19 chimneys?
-[scoffs]

389
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,692
No.

390
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,321
Oh, you mean like magical keys?

391
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,572
Yeah.

392
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,324
But how did he...

393
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,494
I mean, [stammers] I thought
that hardly anyone knew about those.

394
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,748
That may be a story for another day.

395
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,416
Okay. Sure, yeah.

396
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,668
Yeah, no rush...

397
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,176
Your secret's safe with me.
I hope you know that.

398
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:15,969
I do.

399
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,514
-[doorbell rings]
-Thank you.

400
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,271
[Nina] Kinsey!
Someone's at the door for you!

401
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,483
I'll be right back, okay?

402
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,612
[blows breath]

403
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,162
Your mum let me in.

404
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,205
[Scot chuckles]

405
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,915
She's really quite friendly.

406
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,459
Kept calling me "Scot with one T."

407
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,170
-It was--
-I thought you were pissed at me.

408
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,339
[stammers] I've been... I was.

409
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,799
Look, I really was.

410
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:54,716
But, you know,

411
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,969
then what happened
happened and I just...

412
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,179
I mean, that kind of thing is...

413
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,307
it's bloody unbelievable, isn't it?
[chuckles]

414
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,310
So it kinda puts everything else
into perspective, and...

415
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,439
yeah, it just...
it seems kinda silly to be mad now.

416
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,234
I'm glad.

417
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,366
Listen, Scot, you should know that I'm--

418
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,702
That you're sorry?
Yeah, I know you're sorry.

419
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,912
Yeah, I am. I'm really sorry,
but also, you know--

420
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,707
Why don't we just
consider that box ticked, yeah?

421
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,209
I only get like 30 minutes on break
from work

422
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,837
and I already spent half of that time
getting my poxy car started

423
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,088
and driving over here, so...

424
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,299
if it's all right with you,
I would like to spend

425
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,301
what little time we have...

426
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,597
giving you this.

427
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,848
[chuckles]

428
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,726
Not rocky road?

429
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,436
[takes a breath] Yeah, I thought...

430
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,106
maybe just, like, a little bit too soon

431
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,483
even for me. [chuckles]

432
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,695
[approaching footsteps]

433
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,530
Hey, Scot.

434
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,159
Hey.

435
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,662
Gabe just came by to,
you know, see how I was.

436
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,122
Right. Yeah.

437
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,248
[clears throat] Yeah, yeah.

438
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,709
-Come in. Hang out with us.
-No, no, no. I shouldn't. I, uh...

439
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,252
[stammers] I'm due back in a few.

440
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,504
And my car's acting up.

441
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,672
And also I need a--

442
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,259
I need a good few minutes
to get the old apron on nicely.

443
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,679
So, uh, I'll just... [stammers]

444
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,181
I'll see you soon.

445
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,141
[heartfelt instrumentals]

446
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,728
I'm really glad you're okay.

447
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,148
Thanks... for the mint chip.

448
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:35,984
Right.

449
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,327
[door opens]

450
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,371
[door closes]

451
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,873
[Gabe clears throat]

452
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,419
I should probably head out, too.

453
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,797
Oh. Okay.

454
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,967
But I'm gonna give him, like,
a minute's head start if that's cool.

455
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,762
[seagulls cawing]

456
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:08,183
This is not easy.

457
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,560
Beats being home.

458
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,438
Is it hard to be there
after what happened?

459
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,524
It's not really that.

460
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,733
It's just...

461
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,820
Tyler and Kinsey have been
keeping secrets from me again.

462
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,822
And it's super frustrating.

463
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,283
How do you know
they're keeping secrets from you?

464
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,909
Wouldn't that be secret?

465
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,661
They think they're protecting me.

466
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,204
But they're wrong.

467
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,499
Just because they're older
doesn't mean they're right.

468
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,966
What's up?

469
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,094
If your direct commander
wanted you to keep...

470
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,347
sensitive intel on an enemy classified,

471
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,016
would you,

472
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,810
under any circumstances,

473
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,395
disobey that order?

474
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,731
Do you have an enemy, too?

475
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,275
Or are we talking about mine?

476
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,401
[approaching footsteps]

477
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,485
[Lucas] Rufus.

478
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,072
Who's your little friend?

479
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,490
[tense instrumentals]

480
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,617
This is Bode.

481
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,412
Bode, this is...

482
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,414
my cousin.

483
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,167
We're really busy right now.

484
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,293
I can see that.

485
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,135
So, I didn't know that Rufus had a cousin.

486
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,012
Where are you from?

487
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,722
Nowhere in particular.

488
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,099
Move around a lot.

489
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,227
I like living with Ellie, though.

490
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,482
Sorry to hear
about what happened at your house.

491
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,192
Thanks,

492
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,987
but like Rufus said,
we're sort of busy right now.

493
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,822
[Ellie] Hey, guys!

494
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,492
Brought you some fresh cookies...

495
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,912
You said you were going to be out
all afternoon.

496
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,790
-Well, I just got back.
-[Ellie takes a deep breath]

497
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,877
You guys want some ice cream
to go with these?

498
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,795
Yeah!

499
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,557

Mom?

507
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,100
What's wrong?

508
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,268
[Nina exhales]

509
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:57,978
[stammers] I...

510
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,980
I broke this earlier.

511
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,983
It was in pieces and I put those pieces

512
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,359
in this cabinet and I--

513
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,528
-I... [sighs]
-[door squeaks closed]

514
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,113
I locked them in there.

515
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,906
And then when I opened it just now,

516
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,284
my mug... [exhales]

517
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,202
[sharp inhale] it was just sitting there!

518
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,872
Fixed! Like new,

00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,416
like magic or something! [catches breath]

520
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,001
But that's insane.

-[trembles]
-Yeah, I do.

530
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,875
It's not just this. The--

531
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,836
This morning, [stammering]
I looked into the mirror

532
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,671
and I saw...

533
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,132
me, but it wasn't really.

534
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,967
It wasn't a reflection.

535
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,261
She wanted me to join her, to...

536
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,930
to step into the mirror...

537
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,477
Kinsey, I know how this is gonna sound,

538
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,563
[inhales] but I think I did
step into the mirror once.

[Nina catches breath]

540
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,525
I think I got lost in there.

Hi, Erin.

And I get why you did it.

Mom, you are not to blame for Sam.

That I can promise you.

825

I saw where Rendell hid the Omega Key.

838

He put it inside his own head.
