It must be pretty different

you can't just walk into my house.

00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,494
So I guess you told her, huh?

534
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,454
[continued chatter]

535
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,957
How'd Eden react?

536
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,501
Surprisingly well.

537
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:35,672
[Tyler] Uh...

538
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,590
I'm gonna go get some snacks for everyone.

539
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,300
-You want anything?
-I'm good.

540
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,056
[Scot] Eden okay?

541
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,517
-Yeah, she'll be fine.
-[Scot] Good.

542
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,518
Good.

543
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,479
I mean, she's not exactly
my favorite person in the world,

544
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,441
but life would be a lot less interesting
without her, right? [laughs]

545
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,861
So, she got attacked
by a seven pound feral cat?

546
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,030
-[scoffs] 'Cause that makes total sense.
-[Scot] Mm-hmm...

547
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,159
Okay, here's what actually happened.

548
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,205
I used one of the keys
to take the fear out of my head.

549
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,249
[Gabe sighs]

550
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,335
And everything was great for a while.

551
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,006
Then things got messed up.

552
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,634
I let myself get close to you...

553
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,888
even though we were already a thing.

554
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,393
I wasn't worrying about the consequences.

555
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,606
-[sighs] You're both amazing.
-[Gabe scoffs]

556
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,567
I mean, that's the problem.

557
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,862
I know I should choose, but...

558
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,823
I don't want to.

559
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,036
[curious instrumentals]

560
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,164
What if I didn't?

561
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,501
What if I dated you both?

562
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,712
-[phone buzzes]
-[Kinsey stammers]

563
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,089
-[Scot] So--
-Think about it.

564
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,716
-[continued buzzing]
-Just give me a sec.

565
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,759
[Scot stammers]

566
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,261
-Hello?
-It's Ellie. I--

567
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,096
I thought about what you said.

568
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,474
Can we meet at Key House?

569
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,850
[mellow instrumentals]

570
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,156
[engine turns off]

571
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,258
[car door closes]

572
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,260
[approaching footsteps]

573
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,513
[birds chirping]

574
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,518
[Daniel] Nina.

575
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,644
[church bell rings]

576
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,145
Detective.

577
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,899
-Daniel. [chuckles] Hi.
-Uh...

578
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,568
Are you... you going to the meeting?

579
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,403
-[bell ringing continues]
-[church door opens]

580
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,530
I, uh... I thought so, but...

581
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,698
[church door closes]

582
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,033
I don't think I'm in the right place.

583
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,829
Ah. Well, maybe...

584
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,915
-you'd like to get some coffee instead?
-[church door opens]

585
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,044
-[chuckles]
-[church door closes]

586
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,046
-Come on.
-[giggles]

587
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,925
-[crickets chirp]
-[dubious instrumentals]

588
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,639
You have to understand, I was doing
what I thought was best for my son...

589
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,270
but I'm done being afraid.

590
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,316
Lucas, the one that I knew,

591
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,651
was sweet

592
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,653
and charming.

593
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,531
Dodge, that was my nickname for him.

594
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,116
He was on the fencing team.

595
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,369
[laughs] It's a little cheesy,
I know, but...

596
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,958
Now that name means something
completely different to me.

597
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,628
What happened to him?

598
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,800
The night after graduation,
we had a sleepover here in the basement,

599
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,179
but Rendell wanted to go down
to the caves.

600
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:14,599
A few weeks earlier,
we had found this door down there.

601
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,061
Yeah, we know about it.

602
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,648
Your father became obsessed
with getting it open,

603
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,816
and we all went

604
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,612
because the keys had only brought
good things into our lives.

605
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,238
How do you remember any of it?

606
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,658
The keys, the magic?

607
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,994
We thought after you become an adult,
you forget.

608
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,247
We found a way to remember.

609
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,211
After Rendell opened the black door,

610
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,838
there was this bright, blue light.

611
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,548
Then, these...

612
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,051
things shot out from the other side

613
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,929
like... like bullets, glowing bullets.

614
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,808
[exhales shakily]
I saw one of them hit Lucas.

615
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,397
Rendell and Lucas
managed to get the door closed again

616
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,483
and Lucas said he was fine,

617
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,111
and he did seem fine.

618
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,867
But later... [sighs]

619
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,205
[Ellie sighs]

620
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,375
I think it's easier if I just show you.

621
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,385
[neck opening crinkles]

622
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,887
[key crunches in opening]

623
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,055
[whirring]

624
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,273
-What?
-[Ellie] Rufus and Bode,

625
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,441
you two stay here.

626
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,817
Keep watch. We won't be long.

627
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,318
[suspenseful instrumentals]

628
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,239
[rushing effect]

629
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,166
[mellow instrumentals]

630
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,421
We got back from the caves
later that night,

631
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,965
tried to get some sleep,

632
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,634
after opening the black door

633
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,387
and that's when it started with Lucas.

634
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,727
[Lucas] Just hand it over, Mark.

635
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,229
[Mark] Hey, shh, be quiet!
Everyone's asleep! What do you want?

636
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,939
[Lucas] Hand it over. I know you have it.

637
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,483
-[Mark] What are you talking--
-Lucas?

638
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,984
[Mark] What is wrong with you?

639
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,403
Give me the Omega Key.

640
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,030
Lucas, what's going on?

641
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,365
-He's acting crazy.
-I know you have it.

642
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,535
-[Mark] Dude, just calm down.
-Lucas, what are you doing? Lucas?

643
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,828
-[Rendell] What the hell?
-Stop!

644
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,539
-[young Ellie] Lucas!
-[Mark] Make him stop.

645
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,625
-[Mark] Lucas!
-[Lucas, yelling] Just give me

646
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:46,876
what I want!

647
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,711
[Erin] Stop it! What are you doing?

648
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,505
[young Ellie] Let him go!
What are you doing?

649
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,547
[Rendell] Stop!

650
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,382

654
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,601
[young Ellie] Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

655
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,812
[yelling] No, no, what did you do?

656
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,563
[young Ellie exhales sharply]

657
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,649
-He's not Lucas anymore.
-[Lucas grunts]

658
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,567
-[Rendell] What is wrong with you?
-[Erin] Jeff?

[Erin] Kim!

662
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,199
[Rendell] What are you doing?

663
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,826
[young Ellie gasping]

664
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,077

[young Ellie sobs]

674
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,105
[young Duncan] Rendell?

675
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,067
[Ellie] Duncan saw what happened.

676
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,028
We had no choice.

677
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,490
We had to remove his memories...

678
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,994
put them some place he wouldn't find them.

679
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,538
The tree.

680
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,250
[young Ellie cries]

681
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,878
[Ellie] When Lucas got hit

682
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,214
by whatever came across
from the other side,

683
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,343
some kind of demon attached itself to him.

684
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,637
[whirring]

685
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,765
[seagull cawing]

686
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,685
[Ellie] We created a story
about how our friends had died.

687
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,565
It was easier
than trying to explain the truth.

688
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,485
No one would have believed
what really happened.

689
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,365
So we told everyone that we went down to
the caves and our friends drowned...

690
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,245
and the bodies washed out to sea
and they were battered on the rocks.

691
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,956
[waves crashing]

692
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,006
[muffled splash]

693
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,469
[muffled splashing]

694
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,098
[bubbling]

695
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,314
[Ellie] We divided up the remaining keys
and we made a pact

696
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,275
to protect them and never use them again.

697
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,737
Rendell took the Anywhere and Omega Keys,

698
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,489
-[keys rattle]
-Erin took the Head Key,

699
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,158
and Mark took the Matchstick Key.

700
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,952
Mark hid the rest in the house.

701
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,745
He was the most trustworthy of us all,

702
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,414
so it made sense that he should know
where all the keys were hidden.

703
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:34,168
That's why he killed himself,
so no one could ever get inside his head,

704
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,254
to protect the keys.

705
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,463
What about you?

706
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:39,966
What did you take?

707
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,345

[Kinsey] When Bode met Dodge,

775
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,056
he was a she.

776
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,434
She can use the Identity Key
to transform into any form

777
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,978
she thinks will be most useful.

778
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,272
So Dodge is... an echo.

782
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,073
but it can be trapped in the Well House.
