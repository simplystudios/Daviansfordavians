[song intensifies, then fades to silence]

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,518
[Daniel] Here you go, two lattes.

4
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,186
It's perfect.

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,189
Thanks for suggesting this.

6
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,524
[folk music plays softly]

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,821
Six years of sobriety,
just... poof. [scoffs]

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,948
Slips happen.

9
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,577
They don't erase the progress
that you've made.

10
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,208
That day at our house
when you came by to check on us,

11
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,878
you knew, didn't you?

12
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:46,755
I suspected.

13
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,550
Everybody's recovery is different,
but what worked for me

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,135
was small steps.

15
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,721
It's all about tomorrow,

16
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,389
not the next year,

17
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,183
or the next five.

18
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,810
I just feel stuck in today.

19
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,605
[scoffs] Whatever step
that's supposed to be.

20
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,983
Matheson...

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,986
[taps table] was supposed to be
our fresh start.

22
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,491
I thought I'd feel closer to my husband,

23
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,659
connect some dots about his past,

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,706
[inhales] but it hasn't quite worked out
the way I hoped. [sighs]

25
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,292
Maybe living here...

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,544
is not healthy for me...

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,880
or my kids.

28
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,385

-[owl hooting]
-Where's Ellie?

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,432
It's only been an hour.

31
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,685
[Bode] She should've been here by now
with the crown.

32
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,437
[Tyler] We just need to wait,

33
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,897
and stay ready.

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,607
What happens if Mom comes home?

35
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,400
This'll all be over by then.

36
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,694
[insects trilling]

37
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,823
Uh... Guys?

38
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,658
Look!

-[suspenseful instrumentals]
-[gravel crunching]

40
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,964
I hope you don't mind,

41
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,716
I invited some friends.

42
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,140
Shit.

45
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,281
Just... a scare tactic.

46
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,410
Shadows are just shadows.

47
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,331

52
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,307

-[Kinsey] What do you see?

55
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,407
-There's nothing out there.
-[Bode sighs] I don't like this.

56
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,784
[Kinsey] Where did she go?

57
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,204
[Tyler] Did you lock the side door?

[whispering intensifies]

61
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,554
[Tyler] It's too quiet.

62
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,764
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

63
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,973
Not without me.

64
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,059
[Bode] Well, you just can't leave me here.

65
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,729

-It's the lights.

00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,845
That's what stops them!

-[crickets chirping]

-It's in the basement.

99

[Kinsey] Guys?

139
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,905
Come see this!

Did I kill her?

[Kinsey sighs]

144
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,094
[Bode] After I stabbed her,
her shadow melted downstairs.

145
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,398
She's still breathing.

146
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,114
[Tyler] Whatever you did,

147
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,616
she's out cold.

148
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,410
[stammers] Where's the crown?

149
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,871
[Tyler] I don't know,
but first things first,

150
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,581
is the Omega Key still safe?

151
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,672
[door creaks open]

152
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,219
Affirmative.

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,304
[both sigh in relief]

154
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,433
-What do we do with her now?
-[Kinsey] We can't kill her.

155
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,601
Why not?

156
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,728
She's the reason why Dad is gone.

157
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,106
I mean, we literally can't kill her.

158
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,567
Ellie said Echoes can't be killed
by normal means.

159
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,944
Maybe we can put her back
in the well house.

160
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,737
We'll need the Echo Key for that,

161
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,905
but Ellie has it.

162
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,408
What if we send her back
where she came from?

163
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,910
What are you talking about?

164
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,495
The Black Door!

165
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,707
We use the Omega Key
to open the Black Door and send her back.

166
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,292
The last time that door was opened,

167
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,045
Dad's friend got possessed by a demon
and he had to bludgeon him to death.

168
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,714
What happens if she wakes up?

169
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,799
If you have any better ideas,
I'm all ears.

170
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,967
[sighs]

171
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,886
[Bode] Wait,
so we're going to the sea caves?

172
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,138
No, you're not,

173
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,306
we are.

174
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,016
You're staying here.

175
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,935
Fine, but I'm gonna go check on Rufus.

176
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,521
He and Ellie were supposed to come back
with the crown.

177
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,773
If Ellie's in trouble, he could be too.

178
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,275
That's not a good idea.

179
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,985
Well, I can't just stay here!

180
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,486
Rufus is my friend,

181
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,406
and I don't care what you guys say,
[retracts sword]

182
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,365
I'm going.

183
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,117
Just don't do anything stupid.

184
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,660
-You either.
-[Tyler sighs]

185
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,667
[Tyler] If we're gonna carry her
all the way down to those caves,

186
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,628
we're gonna need some help.

187
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,046
[knocking at door]

188
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,633
Demon Disposal Service, you rang?

189
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,218
-Thanks for coming.
-[Gabe] No problem.

190
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,054
-[crickets chirping]
-We brought back up too.

191
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,265
[sighs heavily] Scot told us
you needed help.

192
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,934
Yeah, and the FOMO was real.

193
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,733
Wow, Eden, I... I did not expect this.

194
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:54,737
Well, I was feeling a little bit generous
after my brush with death.

195
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,280
Plus, I don't know who this bitch is,

196
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,659
but she's not about to let
some rando demons run through my town.

197
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,993
Well put.

198
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,995
Yeah, we would've called
the rest of the Savinis,

199
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,290
but you know, they still have
a little bit of "Cave PTSD," so...

200
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,793
-[Scot laughs]
-It's okay, this is awesome.

201
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,880
[long exhale] And I'm sorry
I freaked out earlier.

202
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,883
I... Mostly I'm just sorry
that you didn't think

203
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,219
you could tell me
about all this stuff sooner.

204
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,889
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't think
that was gonna go over so well.

205
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,016
-[heartfelt instrumentals]
-I get that,

206
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,894
but I'm not scared.

207
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,980
Then you're way ahead of me.

208
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,151
-[chuckles]
-And I'm not going anywhere.

209
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,279
[Scot clears throat]

210
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,824
Sorry, sorry. It was--

211
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,034
It was nice, like a really sweet moment,

212
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,288
but I just feel like
we have a demon to be dealing with, and...

213
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,166
You know, uh, so where is she?

214
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,711
He-- It-- [stammers]
I don't know what the pronoun is,

215
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,838
demon non-binary. What are we doing?

216
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,090
[dramatic instrumentals]

217
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,310
Not exactly what I picture
when I think of "formidable demon."

218
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,604
[Scot] Really? Pretty much
exactly what I was expecting.

219
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,315
Oh, come on. Where are the fangs?
Where are the horns?

220
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,900
-Where are the--
-No, no, this is all--

221
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,361
This is all meant to lull you
into a false sense of security.

222
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,946
You know, the perfect bone structure

223
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,239
and the impeccable style--

224
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,533
Guys, can we focus?

225
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,494
Where'd you put the flashlights?

226
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,495
I'll get them.

227
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,832
[camera shutters]

228
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,958
What?

229
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,418
Do not post that.

230
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,755
Fine.

231
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,964
[cover rustles]

232
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,591
-[insects trilling]
-[owl hooting]

233
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,010
[Scot stammers] I guess it makes sense
really, doesn't it?

234
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,137
Demons have to be disposed of properly,

235
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,433
so throwing them behind a big demon door
just seems logical, doesn't it? [laughs]

236
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,519
You know, that being said, I don't know,

237
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,646
I feel like this is a little bit doomed,
you know?

238
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,482
I'm not saying like it is doomed,

239
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,193
but I definitely feel like
we're walking towards the Gates of Mordor.

240
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,527
[Eden] Can I ask a question?

241
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,696
Besides, Scot, can you stop talking?

242
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,156
[Gabe] Yes, go, Eden.

243
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,408
[Eden] So what happens if she wakes up?

244
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,285
Like do we have a plan for that?

245
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,078
-[sighing]
-[Tyler] I brought a knife.

246
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,581
[Eden] Oh, you're gonna have a knife-fight
with the demon?

247
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,833
[Kinsey] You can't kill her with a knife.

248
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,002
[Tyler] Might at least give us
a head start.

249
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,587
Okay, any more questions?

250
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,923
Yeah, can we just get this over with?

251
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,009
[waves crashing]

252
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,136
[dubious instrumentals]

253
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,015
[Kinsey sighs] How's the tide situation?

254
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,726
It's just past full-low.

255
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,853
We're okay if we go now.

256
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,896
Are we?

257
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,900
Look, no one has to go down.

258
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,943
No, we're going.

259
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,946
I mean, at least I am.

260
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,323
Me too.

261
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,201
Yeah, of course.

262
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,584
Not one to resist some good,
old-fashioned peer pressure, am I?

263
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,628
I'm in.

264
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,631
-[swelling instrumentals]
-[bike chain rattling]

265
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,803
[Bode yelling] Rufus?

266
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:07,721
Ellie?

267
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,433
Rufus?

268
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,019
Rufus?

269
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,149
Rufus! Rufus!

270
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,776
Rufus,

271
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,694
wake up!

272
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,030
Help!

273
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,825
[waves crashing]

274
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,759
[dubious instrumentals]

275
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,888
Here we go again.

276
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,848
Watch your head.

277
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,686
[Scot] It's worse than last time.

278
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,860
-[grunting]
-How did you guys find this place?

279
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,862
[Kinsey] We were gonna shoot the movie
in here.

280
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:08,115
[laughs] Yeah, no, I would've quit
if I hadn't already quit.

281
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,867
[Gabe] Go ahead. I got it.

282
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,368
[groaning and sighing]

283
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,622
[Jackie] Okay.

284
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,832
-[Tyler grunts]
-Well, that was fun.

285
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,169
[hushed indistinct whispering]

286
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,047
[Kinsey sighs]

287
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,550
[low droning]

288
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,138
You're hearing that, right?

289
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,476
You mean the really scary
rumbling sound?

290
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,940
[feet shuffling]

291
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,276
[heavy breathing]

292
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,374
[grunting and groaning]

293
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,006
[Scot] What do you suppose
is on the other side of this?

294
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,174
Nothing good.

295
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,927
Yup. Well, unless you're a demon.

296
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,346
Let's just do this and get out of here.

297
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,515
I don't think we should.

298
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,183
[Tyler] It was your idea!

299
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,479
Does this feel right to you?

300
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,235
If you got any better ideas, I'm all ears.

301
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,404
Best-available idea doesn't make something
a good idea.

302
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,323
Uh, okay, I hate to break up
a good old sibling squabble,

303
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,033
but I am very worried about these tides

304
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,327
and I do have some experience
to back that up.

305
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,079
Shit. Yeah, we should hurry.

306
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,789
That is not what you said before.

307
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,208
Yeah, it took a lot longer
to get down here than I thought.

308
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,377
[rustling]

309
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,878
[Jackie] Is she waking up?

310
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,964
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

311
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,174
[Dodge moans softly]

312
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,343
Hey, guys, we gotta do this now.

313
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,470
Are you sure?

314
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,972
We can't take it back.

315
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,058
Kinsey, we're here.

316
00:16:58,809 --> 00:16:59,977
We can end this...

317
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,312
-[low droning]
-for Dad.

318
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,360
-[suspenseful instrumentals]
-All right.

319
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,613
Okay...

320
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,118
Kinsey will unlock the door,
the rest of you, stay on it.

321
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,537
If something happens, just close it.

322
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,004
I'll carry Dodge to the edge
and throw her through.

323
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,131
And if anything exits that door
when we open it?

324
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,091
Wait, hold on. Anything like what?

325
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,470
Ellie said they were like glowing bullets.

326
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,057
Just don't let them hit you, okay?

327
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,392

That's...

336
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,691
What is that?

337
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,609
[Gabe] Yeah.

338
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,658
-[whirring]
-[Kinsey] Look out!

339
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,034

-[whizzing]

00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,920
What are you doing?

00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:50,838
[Tyler grunts]

344
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,797
[Dodge] No!

345
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,090
No! No!

346
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,009
[Dodge gasping] Tyler, don't!

347
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,094
[screaming] No!

[dramatic instrumentals]

349
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,391
No!

No!

351
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,444
No!

352
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,323
[yelling] Close the door!

00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,548
[heavy breathing]

359
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:35,924
[Scot exhales sharply]

360
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,845
[all sighing]

361
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,388
[Scot chuckles]

362
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,184
[owl hoots in the distance]

363
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,396
[door knob rattles]

364
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,814
[doors rattle open]

365
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,401
Okay, I hope
we never have to do that again.

366
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,528
I don't think that's actually an option.

367
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,113
Is it weird that I kinda had fun?

368
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,907
No weirder than what we just saw.

369
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,409
Tyler, Kinsey, you guys were awesome.

370
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,536
We all did it, everybody.

371
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,248
Do you guys want some food
or something before you leave?

372
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,459
I mean,
it's the least we can do to thank you.

373
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,919
I've always got an appetite.

374
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,212
[Jackie] Yeah, I'm down!

375
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,715
-Kins?
-[retreating footsteps]

376
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,050
You got a minute?

377
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,801
[heartfelt instrumentals]

378
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,429
Uh... [chuckles]

379
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:27,017
I know this probably isn't necessarily
the best time to do this, but, uh...

380
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,478
I've been thinking a lot about...

381
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,521
your notion

382
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,359
that Gabe and I both date you... [laughs]

383
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,110
and...

384
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,197
I've just gotta say that that's...

385
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,491
that's not gonna work for me.

386
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,120
So, if you're undecided, then... [scoffs]

387
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,582
then that is your decision.

388
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,835
I understand.

389
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,215
Right.

390
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,717
Great. So, I mean, we can be friends.

391
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,427
You know, great friends, I hope.

392
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,430
Right? Tried and true,
bonded by demons

393
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,391
and magic and all sorts. [laughs]

394
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:08,809
Yeah?

395
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,185
I hope so too.

396
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,408
[chuckling] Okay, so my mom

397
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,743
-is gonna live until she's 109.
-[giggling]

398
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,371
She has more energy than I had
when I was 20.

399
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,665
-Ooh.
-She comes up here to visit me sometimes,

400
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,668
but mostly because she wants
to clean my house.

401
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,003
[laughing] No, and you let her?

402
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,171
-Yes! Try and stop her!
-[laughs heartily]

403
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,716
I may be a cop,
but I am not saying no to Mom.

404
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,467
-[phone buzzing]
-Oh, uh...

405
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,344
[Nina clears throat]

406
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,054
Matuku.

407
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,098
Yeah.

408
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,808
[indistinct chatter]

409
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,018
Yeah.

410
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,603
Okay, on my way.

411
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,648
Police business.

412
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,858
Afraid so.

413
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,443
I, uh... I gotta go.

414
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,153
Of course. [chuckles]

415
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,155
[both laugh]

416
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,990
I really enjoyed this.

417
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,241
Yeah, me too.

418
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,202
[Nina laughs]

419
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,624
[dishes clatter]

420
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,168
[clicks tongue]

421
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,337
[folk music plays softly]

422
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,048
[indistinct police radio chatter]

423
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,883
[indistinct chatter]

424
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,389
Hey.

425
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,560
Your friend's okay.

426
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,356
They're gonna take him to the hospital
so he can get checked out.

427
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,609
You can go see him now, if you want.

428
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,652
Thanks.

429
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,949
[continued chatter]

430
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,035
-Bode.
-Are you okay?

431
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,038
-[distant police sirens]
-[sighs] I usually feel a lot better.

432
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,456
Well, what happened?

433
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,999
Where's your mom?

434
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,751
[stammers] I don't know.

435
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,758
Lucas used one of the keys
to turn himself into a lady,

436
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,928
with long, black hair.

437
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,806
That's Dodge.

438
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,058
Here.

439
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,646
Take this.

440
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,231
[dramatic instrumentals]

441
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,651
Rufus, you okay there?

442
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,027
Affirmative.

443
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,739
Sorry, kid, we gotta go now.

444
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,035
Goodbye, Bode.

445
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,578
Bye, Rufus.

446
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,664
[engine rumbles]

447
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,463
[engine revs]

448
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,844
[ambulance siren wails]

449
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,143
Where's Dodge?

450
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,978
[Tyler] She's gone, for good.

451
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,397
So you threw her through the door?

452
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,941
-In the cave?
-[Tyler] Yeah.

453
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,152
Are you sure it was Dodge?

454
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,696
Why would you ask that?

455
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,781
I went to Rufus' house, right?

456
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,907
Right.

457
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,160
When I got there, Rufus was knocked out.

458
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,204
So I called 911 and the police came,

459
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,747
and his mom was missing.

460
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,625
And then when he woke up,
he told me

461
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,795
-that Lucas did it.
-[Tyler] Wait, what?

462
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,338
Where's Ellie?

463
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,132
Nobody knows.

464
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,010
And since Lucas is Dodge,

465
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,221
I just wanted to make sure
you guys got rid of her.

466
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,102
Trust me.

467
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,354
She's gone.

468
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:46,735
We both saw her get swallowed up
in whatever was on the other side.

469
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,279
[Tyler sighs]

470
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,614
[Kinsey] Okay?

471
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,241
-[kisses]
-Okay? [pats legs]

472
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,951
We're safe now.

473
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,955
Okay. [sighs]

474
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,291
-[serene instrumentals]
-[birds chirping]

475
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,877
[dishes clinking]

476
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,171
-[sizzling]
-[spatula clatters in pan]

477
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,881
[rattling on stove]

478
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,264
[Duncan] Hey, late risers!

479
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,641
-Uncle Dunc!
-[Duncan] Hey...

480
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,018
What, you guys have a raucous night
or something last night?

481
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,145
-[sighs] Or something.
-[Nina] Get it while it's hot!

482
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,023
Look at this spread! Did you make this?

483
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,234
[Duncan] No, no, this was all your mom!

484
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,319
[muffled] Delicioso!

485
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,615
Does anyone know what happened
to Dad's car?

486
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:38,370
I was driving it to the store this morning
and something's wrong with the steering.

487
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,955
It was shaking and wobbling...

488
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,166
[laughs] I felt like
I was riding in a blender!

489
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,669
I guess I'll have to, uh,

490
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,629
-take it to the shop.
-[utensils clinking]

491
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,840
When I was at the store,
I saw Bernadette from school.

492
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,052
Nobody's heard a word about Ellie.

493
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,220
Nothing?

494
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:58,515
[Nina] No, so weird. What about Rufus?

495
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,892
He slept with some neighbors last night,

496
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,436
and his aunt and uncle are flying in
from Nebraska this morning.

497
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,354
[Nina sighs]

498
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,481
Anyway...

499
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,526
before everyone runs off,

500
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,945
we need to have a little family meeting.

501
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:12,946
It's important.

502
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,115
And you're gonna need to hear this too.

503
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,200
Okay...

504
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,868
What about?

505
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,786
[Duncan] Yeah.

506
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,751
I made a mistake

507
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,628
moving us here.

508
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,257
I thought it was a good idea at the time.

509
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,219
I wanted to learn more
about your Dad's past,

510
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,264
and I thought the change would do us good.

511
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,807
[heartfelt instrumentals]

512
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:45,145
I dragged all of you out here
against your wishes, and now,

513
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,856
we get to go back home.

514
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,445
[voice shaking]
This house is in good enough shape

515
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,030
for us to sell, and...

516
00:26:56,364 --> 00:27:00,160
we can use that money
to buy a great new house in Seattle.

517
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,911
And that will be our house!

518
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,540
We'll just consider this
a necessary little side-trip...

519
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,459
At least, for me.

520
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,546
But now,
we get to go back to our normal lives.

521
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,219
[stammers] Okay.

522
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,972
Don't everybody jump for joy
all at once. [chuckles]

523
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,851
We actually like it here.

524
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,814
[Tyler] Yeah. I mean, it did seem
like a shitty idea at the time.

525
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,025
Now, we love it here!

526
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:36,613
I wouldn't say love it,
but I don't... I don't wanna move again.

527
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,365
Me either.

528
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,158
Seriously?

529
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,453
[stammers] You guys want to stay?

530
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,121
Yeah, definitely.

531
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,166
-I thought you guys hated this place.
-[Tyler] We did,

532
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,669
until... until we didn't.

533
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,172
Because we finally got good WiFi.

534
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,007
[all laughing]

535
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,135
And maybe Dad didn't always love it here,

536
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,513

-[Nina chuckles] Okay.

Well, I'm just processing all of this.

like I made a horrible mistake.

552
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,685
I hope you're getting settled
at your uncle's house.

so it must be a pretty great place.

I'm going to figure it out.

561
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,962
At first, these keys were fun,

562
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:17,881
but now we know

563
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,215
that they're more than that.

564
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,759
They're important.

565
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,136
They're part of our family...

[heartfelt instrumentals continue]

567

One more thing,

00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,364
mail me a picture of the front door
of your uncle's house,

571
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,034
because if I do get back
that Anywhere Key,

572
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,244
I'm coming straight to Nebraska!

Going fishing with Jackie.

I think it has something to do
with the magic.

go down there.
